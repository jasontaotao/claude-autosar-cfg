## v1.18.3 (2026-06-30) — PATCH

WriteAtomic fsync gap closure — closes the v1.17.0 spec §15.1 Batch 4 deferred non-goal (4th-oldest carry-over). 1 commit on main.

- **`feat(generator)`** — `writeOutputTree` now calls `fs.open(tmpPath, 'r+')` + `fh.sync()` + `fh.close()` between `writeFile` and `rename`. Mirrors the existing main-side pattern at `src/main/io/writeAtomic.ts:36-41` (which already fsyncs). Without fsync, the rename could publish a file whose content was still in the OS page cache; a power loss / OS crash between rename and flush would leave the file torn. After this change, generator output survives a crash between write and rename.

**Why this matters**: the `generate` CLI sub-command (called via `autosarcfg generate ...`) writes generator output to disk. Prior to this PATCH, killing the process mid-write could leave files in a torn state (zero-byte content or truncated). Same risk class as v1.15.5 C1 (`writeAtomic` migration in main-side script handler); v1.18.3 closes the CLI-side twin.

**Performance note**: fsync adds ~1-10ms per file (SSD/HDD-dependent). For generator pipelines that write dozens-to-hundreds of files, this is a non-trivial cost. Acceptable for crash-safety; if performance becomes a concern, can add a feature flag in a future PATCH.

Test count: v1.18.2 = 2580 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.18.3 = **2582 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+2 net, matches plan forecast exactly). `pnpm verify` 8-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression).

**Deferred to v1.18.x PATCHes** (per v1.18.0 spec §11.1):

- v1.18.4 — C13 subdir refactor (with re-planning per spec §15.2)
- `PROJECT_CLOSE` defensive null-check in `bswmdDeleteHandler` + `projectWriteArxmlBatchHandler` (deferred from v1.18.2 — independent concern)

## v1.18.2 (2026-06-30) — PATCH

PROJECT_CLOSE IPC — closes the v1.17.0 spec §15.1 Batch 4 deferred non-goal (2nd-oldest carry-over). 2 commits on main.

- **`feat(ipc)`** — `IPC_CHANNELS.PROJECT_CLOSE` ('project:close') channel constant + top-level alias + `ProjectCloseResult` type. Symmetric counterpart to `PROJECT_OPEN`. No `:v1` suffix: state-mutation channel, not wire-versioned. (T1)
- **`feat(ipc)`** — `projectCloseHandler` extracted to `src/main/ipc/projectCloseHandler.ts` for direct testability (mirrors `bswmdDeleteHandler` pattern). Pure function: calls `setOpenProjectManifestPath(null)` + returns `{ kind: 'closed' }`. Registered in `src/main/ipc/register.ts` via `ipcMain.handle`. (T2)

**Idempotent semantics**: calling PROJECT_CLOSE when no project is open returns `{ kind: 'closed' }` (Unix `close(2)` semantics). The renderer never needs to track is-a-project-open state.

**Known limitation**: `bswmdDeleteHandler` + `projectWriteArxmlBatchHandler` read manifest path state without null-check. After PROJECT_CLOSE, calling BSWMD_DELETE will crash (the state reads null but the handler assumes non-null). The fix is a 1-line defensive null-check in each consumer handler — deferred to a follow-up PATCH per plan §0.4.

Test count: v1.18.1 = 2576 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.18.2 = **2580 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+4 net, matches plan forecast exactly). `pnpm verify` 8-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression).

**Future consumer**: v1.19.0 MINOR GUI bridge will add renderer-side `useProjectActions.closeProject` hook (currently the renderer never calls PROJECT_CLOSE).

**Deferred to v1.18.x PATCHes** (per v1.18.0 spec §11.1):

- v1.18.3 — WriteAtomic fsync gap in `post-process.ts`
- v1.18.4 — C13 subdir refactor (with re-planning per spec §15.2)

## v1.18.1 (2026-06-30) — PATCH

Headless push channel emitters — closes the v1.17.0 spec §15.1 Batch 4 deferred non-goal. 2 commits on `feature/v1-18-1-patch` branch (T1 wire types + T2 emitters).

- **`feat(headless)`** — wire types for push channel events (T1). `MutateAppliedEvent` (subset of `MutateResult`: `patchId` + `applied` + `warnings`) and `ValidateResultEvent` (type-aliases `ValidateResult`) added to `src/shared/headless/ipc-contract.ts`. Type-only addition; no consumers yet.
- **`feat(headless)`** — push channel emitters (T2). New `src/main/headless/push-emitters.ts` exposes `emitMutateApplied(event)` + `emitValidateResult(event)`. Both snapshot `getMainWindow()`, guard with `null === null || mainWindow.isDestroyed()`, then call `mainWindow.webContents.send(channel, event)`. Mirrors the SCRIPT_PROGRESS push pattern at `src/main/ipc/script-handler.ts:312-336`. In CLI mode (standalone `bin/autosarcfg.mjs`) the emitters are no-ops because there is no main window — correct: the CLI does not own a renderer.

Test count: v1.18.0 = 2571 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.18.1 = **2576 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+5 net). `pnpm verify` 8-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression).

**Future consumer**: v1.19.0 MINOR will replace `headlessRunCommandStub` with a real dispatcher that calls these emitters when a headless command completes inside the Electron main process. Renderer integration is part of the GUI bridge design.

**Deferred to v1.18.x PATCHes** (per v1.18.0 spec §11.1):

- v1.18.2 — `PROJECT_CLOSE` IPC
- v1.18.3 — WriteAtomic fsync gap in `post-process.ts`
- v1.18.4 — C13 subdir refactor (with re-planning per spec §15.2)

## v1.18.0 (2026-06-30) — MINOR

Batch 2 + Batch 3 carry-overs from v1.17.0 spec §15.1. **7 items shipped** (C13 deferred to v1.18.4 PATCH per spec §15.2 — 4 critical drifts caught at implementation time). 10 commits on `feature/v1-18-0-minor` branch; squash to 1 on main.

- **`feat(apply)`** — `ApplyResult.warnings: ReadonlyArray<StepWarning>` + `StepWarning` interface (T1 Obs-3). New non-fatal diagnostic channel parallel to `errors`. `OneStepResult.warning?` per-step slot; `applyPatchSteps` accumulates warnings. CLI dispatcher already maps non-empty warnings to `EXIT_WARNING` (no dispatcher changes). `MutationStepWarning` wire-shape in `shared/headless/ipc-contract.ts`; `mutate.ts` populates from `result.warnings`.
- **`fix(security)`** — `webPreferences.sandbox: false` → `true` in `src/main/index.ts:37` (T2 SE-1). OS-level Chromium sandbox engaged. Preload bridge audit test pins typed-function-only surface + no Node handles exposed.
- **`fix(renderer)`** — `saveProject` useCallback wrapped in try/catch envelope (T3 IPC-4). Mirrors `openProjectFromDialog` envelope (IPC-5 was already done). 4 tests: happy path, write-failed envelope, thrown Error caught, thrown string caught.
- _(C13 subdir refactor deferred — see §15.2 of spec)_
- **`fix(main)`** — main-side crash recovery dialogs in `src/main/index.ts` (T5 PB-1). Three handlers: `render-process-gone` (error dialog + Reload/Quit), `unresponsive` (warning dialog + Wait/Reload), `gpu-process-crashed` (silent reload). All handlers log via `logFatal`.
- **`feat(main)`** — graceful shutdown drain (T6 PB-3). New `src/main/shutdown/drain.ts` with `trackHandler` / `drainInFlightHandlers` / `_resetForTest`. `app.on('before-quit', ...)` intercepts first quit call, drains in-flight IPC handlers (currently: `scriptRunHandler` as proof-of-concept), then re-quits. `isShuttingDown` re-entrancy guard.
- **`feat(renderer)`** — React ErrorBoundary wraps `<App />` at React tree root (T7 PB-4). Class component (React 18 has no functional equivalent). Default fallback UI: "Something went wrong" + Reset button. Complements T5 (PB-1 main-side crash handlers) — orthogonal failure modes (renderer-render vs process-gone).
- **`feat(variant)`** — variant engineering state machine (T8 C8). New `src/core/variant/engineering.ts` with `decideVariantType(multiplicity)` + `detectVariantDowngrade(prev, next)`. New `src/core/mutation/steps/variant-downgrade.ts` emits `StepWarning { kind: 'variant-downgrade' }`. New `'variant-downgrade'` step op in `PatchStep` union, wired into `applyOneStep` switch. First consumer of `StepWarning` shape from T1.

Test count: v1.17.1 = 2527 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.18.0 = **2571 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+44 net across 7 items: T1 +4 + T2 +3 + T3 +4 + T5 +5 + T6 +5 + T7 +4 + T8 +19). `pnpm verify` 8-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression).

**C13 deferral rationale** (see spec §15.2 for full detail): Phase 0 implementation attempt surfaced 4 critical drifts — AppHeader is 1 cohesive function (not 6 sub-components), `useProjectActions.saveProject` closure shared by 5 sibling useCallbacks, `AppHeader.scripts.test.tsx` asserts monolithic DOM, T3 already created test file assuming subdir barrel. Honest scope options: Option B (co-locate helpers/types, keep bodies monolithic) or Option A (invent sub-components, public API changes). **Defer to v1.18.4 PATCH with proper re-planning.**

**Deferred to v1.18.x PATCHes** (per spec §11.1):

- v1.18.1 — Headless push channel emitters
- v1.18.2 — `PROJECT_CLOSE` IPC
- v1.18.3 — WriteAtomic fsync gap in `post-process.ts`
- v1.18.4 — C13 subdir refactor (with re-planning per spec §15.2)

## v1.17.1 (2026-06-30) — PATCH

T5 M1 follow-up closure from v1.17.0 MINOR. Wires the BrowserWindow `closed` event to clear the window accessor so IPC handlers don't `webContents.send` on a destroyed window. 1 commit on `main` on top of v1.17.0 (`5ce52b7`). No deferrals.

- **`fix(ipc)`** — new `registerMainWindowCloseHandler(window: BrowserWindow)` helper in `src/main/window.ts:55` wires `window.on('closed', () => setMainWindow(null))`. Wired at `src/main/index.ts:53` immediately after `setMainWindow(mainWindow)` to satisfy the documented "call exactly once per BrowserWindow lifetime" invariant. macOS re-activate path is safe — each new `createMainWindow` invocation creates a fresh handler closure bound to its own window.
- **`test(main)`** — `src/main/__tests__/window-close-handler.test.ts` (new file, 2 tests). Tests use a duck-typed fake window (only the `on('closed', cb)` surface is needed) — no `electron` mock required. Consistent with the T5 design intent: "Tests that mock this module — without mocking `electron` — can exercise the IPC emit path in isolation." `afterEach(() => setMainWindow(null))` reset guards against module-scoped state leakage between tests.

Test count: v1.17.0 = 2525 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.17.1 = **2527 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+2 net). `pnpm verify` 8-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression). Code-reviewer APPROVED (0C/0H/0M/0L).

**Local variable note**: the `mainWindow: BrowserWindow | null` in `src/main/index.ts:24` is NOT nulled by the close handler. Acceptable trade-off — nothing reads it post-close (all call sites are inside `createMainWindow` or attached to the window's own webContents, which become inert on destruction), and macOS re-activation reassigns it. No memory leak; just a captured reference that becomes garbage on reassignment.

## v1.17.0 (2026-06-30) — MINOR

Type Rip (Batch 1 of joint-review plan). Closes 4 carry-overs (C9 / C10 / C11 + FIO-2) + 3 Tier 1 new findings (IPC-1 + SE-7 + T3 M1 e2e tests). 7 commits on top of v1.16.1 (`4ca835e`). Batches 2 + 3 defer to v1.18.0 MINOR per spec §15.1.

- **`feat(types)`** — `BswModuleDef.derivedFrom?: string` for `<DERIVED-FROM>` classifier attachment (C9). `ReferenceDef.destDialect?: 'P-PORT' | 'R-PORT' | 'SW-C' | 'ECUC-MODULE-DEF'` for cross-dialect discriminator (C10). `BswmdDocument.moduleRefs?: ReadonlyArray<ModuleRefEntry>` for `<MODULE-REF>` explicit attachment (C11, was previously silently dropped). All three fields OPTIONAL — no breaking changes to existing ARXML outputs.
- **`feat(validation)`** — new BSW-SEC-005 rule (`validateVariantCoverage`) emits error for POST-BUILD parameters lacking variant coverage. Walks `containers` recursively (subContainers + choices).
- **`feat(parser)`** — new `walkPackagesForModuleRefs` helper surfaces `<MODULE-REF>` elements at the document level. Previously silently dropped by `parseBswmd`. Mirrors `walkPackagesForModules` recursion pattern.
- **`fix(fio)`** — `stencilSaveHandler.ts:97` migrated from `await fs.writeFile` to `await writeAtomic` (closes the 6th raw writeFile site v1.15.5 C1 missed). Keeps `path.normalize` `..` guard.
- **`feat(ipc)`** — `SCRIPT_PROGRESS` push channel emit from `scriptRunHandler.onLog` (closes orphan subscription; new `getMainWindow`/`setMainWindow` accessor in dedicated `src/main/window.ts` module to isolate IPC handlers from boot sequence import graph).
- **`fix(security)`** — `applyPatchSteps.replace` rejects non-`{value: string, dest?: string}` shapes on reference params with `patch-invalid` error (was silently coercing via `String(raw)`).

10 exhaustive-switch consumer sites annotated with explicit "no <C9/C10/C11> impact in current scope" comments per Phase 2.5 mandate.

Test count: v1.16.1 = 2505 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail → v1.17.0 = **2525 + 2 SKIP / 0 fail** (+20 net: 3 C10 + 4 C9 + 5 C11 (2 unit + 3 e2e) + 2 FIO-2 + 2 IPC-1 + 4 SE-7 — exceeds plan target of +10 due to extra defensive tests added by T1/T5/T6 implementers). `pnpm verify` 7-stage pipeline green.

**Deferred to v1.18.0 MINOR** per spec §15.1:

- Batch 2 (7 items): C13 AppHeader/useProjectActions split + Obs-3 ApplyResult.warnings + IPC-4/5 envelopes + PB-1/4 crash recovery + PB-3 shutdown drain + SE-1 sandbox flip
- Batch 3 (1 item): C8 variant engineering (coupled to Obs-3 StepWarning shape)

See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-29-v1-17-0-minor-design.md` §15.1.

**Naming note**: this MINOR is called "v1.17.0" externally (semver-correct — first MINOR after v1.16.0) but was tracked internally as the v1.17.0 cycle throughout (plan file, spec file, devlog). The commit messages keep the "v1.17.0" identifier for historical continuity; the tag, CHANGELOG entry, release notes, and GH release use "v1.17.0".

**Re-spec note**: T1 implementer BLOCKED on first dispatch 2026-06-30 due to spec drift (5 fictional file paths + 3 fictional type shapes from aspirational 2026-06-29 spec). Re-spec committed `19de59e` + `ba52620` + `88caeca` (test infra baseline-fix). Phase 2.5 brief-drift correction now includes Shape 7 (file-exists + existing-type-shape verification) per `phase-2-5-brief-drift-correction.md`. All 6 implementation commits (`5c79309`, `affd184`, `76d728c`, `4ca835e`, `ba93228`, `af9445a`) plus M1 follow-up (`3cbc471`) followed the re-spec.

## v1.16.1 (2026-06-30) — PATCH

Script-handler async writeAtomic (FIO-1 from v1.15.5 surface observations). Closes the LAST remaining sync write site in the script-engine manifest path. Code-reviewer-verified 0C/0H/2M (both MEDIUMs addressed); `pnpm verify` 7-stage gate green.

- **`fix(main)`** — `src/main/ipc/script-handler.ts`: sync `writeFileSync` for the script-engine manifest migrated to async `readFile` (from `node:fs/promises`) + `writeAtomic` (from `src/main/io/writeAtomic.ts`). `loadCurrentManifest()` and `writeCurrentManifest(scripts)` are now both `Promise<...>`. 4 callers updated to `await loadCurrentManifest()` (`scriptListHandler`, `scriptSaveHandler`, `scriptDeleteHandler`, `scriptRunHandler`) + 3 callers updated to `await writeCurrentManifest(...)`. New comment block on `writeCurrentManifest` documents v1.16.1 rationale + explicit cross-reference to FIO-2 follow-up.
- **`fix(build)`** — `vite.main.config.ts`: add `'node:fs/promises'` to `rollupOptions.external` (alongside existing `'node:fs'`). Without this, rollup errors at main-process build with `Module 'node:fs/promises' has been externalized for browser compatibility` and refuses to resolve `readFile`. Multi-line array format + comment block explaining the promise-namespaced-fs rationale.
- **`test(main)`** — `src/main/ipc/__tests__/script-handler.test.ts`: new top-level `describe('v1.16.1 PATCH — atomic write invariant')` block with 1 invariant test: "save + update + delete leaves no .tmp-\* leftovers in the project dir". The test was originally inside `describe('script:run handler...')` (MEDIUM #1 review finding — moved out into the dedicated block).

**Naming note**: this PATCH is called "v1.16.1" externally (semver-correct — first PATCH after v1.16.0 MINOR) but was tracked internally as "v1.15.6" (branch name `feature/v1-15-6-patch`, plan file, spec file, devlog). The commit message keeps the internal "v1.15.6" identifier for historical continuity; the tag, CHANGELOG entry, release notes, and GH release use "v1.16.1".

**Deferred to v1.17.0 MINOR** (or paired with FIO-1 in a future PATCH per user's call): **FIO-2** — `stencilSaveHandler.ts:97` still uses raw `await fs.writeFile` (NOT `writeAtomic`). v1.15.5 C1 grep targeted sync-only (`writeFileSync`) and missed this async raw write site. v1.16.1 does not fix FIO-2 (out of scope). The `writeCurrentManifest` comment cross-references FIO-2 so future greps won't re-find the gap.

Test count: v1.16.0 = 259 + 1 SKIP (verify subset) → v1.16.1 = **2505 + 2 SKIP + 0 fail** (+1 net test: the new atomic write invariant). `pnpm verify` 7-stage pipeline green (format / lint / type-check / test / build / smoke). 1 commit on `feature/v1-15-6-patch` (internal name) on top of main HEAD `6d37b00` (v1.16.0 squash). Ship method: `gh api` per v1.15.2/3/4/5 pattern (github.com:443 blocked, api.github.com reachable).

## v1.16.0 (2026-06-29) — MINOR

Layering Hardening (C12 from joint review).

- **`feat(architecture)`** — Renderer can no longer import `@main/*` directly. Closes the joint-review C12 finding (renderer→@main 11 type-only imports smuggling past the package-name ESLint check). Migration: created `src/shared/script/types.ts` re-exporting from `src/main/script/types.ts`; rewrote all 11 renderer import sites from `@main/script/types` to `@shared/script/types`. The re-export is type-only (`export type`), so the new shared file costs zero runtime bytes in either bundle.
- **`chore(eslint)`** — Extended `.eslintrc.cjs` `no-restricted-imports` rule for `src/renderer/**/*.{ts,tsx}` to block `@main` path-alias imports in addition to the existing `electron` package-name check. The path alias was a Vite-only construct (renderer uses it, main doesn't alias `@main` for itself), so the old rule never fired even when the boundary was crossed.

Scope note: the joint-review also flagged 144 `renderer→@core/*` imports. These are NOT violations per the README's "core/ is pure TS, no react/electron/DOM" rule — `@core/*` is renderer-allowed by design. Future audits can distinguish "core reverse imports" (architectural, OK) from "main reverse imports" (forbidden, now blocked).

## v1.15.5 (2026-06-29) — PATCH

Trust Contract + Coverage Hardening. Closes 4 of 13 HIGH-severity findings from the 2026-06-29 joint review (4-agent parallel review + verify agent 13/13 CONFIRMED).

- **`fix(atomic-write)`** — Extract `writeAtomic` to `src/main/io/writeAtomic.ts`; replace 5 raw `fs.writeFile` calls in IPC handlers (`projectSaveHandler`, `saveArxmlHandler`, `projectWriteArxmlBatchHandler`, `projectNewHandler`). fsync + temp + rename atomic-write invariant now enforced across all main-process writes. Existing `projectSaveHandler.atomic.test.ts` migrated to new module.
- **`fix(security)`** — Path-containment via `isPathInside` in `projectWriteArxmlBatchHandler` + `bswmdDeleteHandler`. New `src/main/ipc/project-manifest-state.ts` module-level state mirrors `script-handler.ts:_manifestPath` pattern; `setOpenProjectManifestPath` wired in `projectNewHandler` + `register.ts:PROJECT_OPEN`. `'invalid-path'` Result arm added to 3 union types (`ProjectWriteArxmlBatchResult`, `ProjectDeleteArxmlResult`, `ProjectDeleteBswmdResult`).
- **`feat(ipc)`** — Stub handlers for 5 channels declared in `IPC_CHANNELS` but previously unregistered (`SWS_VALIDATE`, `SWS_VALIDATE_CANCEL`, `HEADLESS_RUN_COMMAND`). `HEADLESS_MUTATE_APPLIED` + `HEADLESS_VALIDATE_RESULT` are push channels and intentionally NOT registered (no renderer listener; would cause dev console "no listener" noise). New `StubHeadlessResult` envelope in `headless/ipc-contract.ts`.
- **`fix(main)`** — `uncaughtException` + `unhandledRejection` safety nets in `main/index.ts` via new `src/main/log.ts` (log-only, no `app.exit` — preserves unsaved BSWMD / manifest work per Electron 2024+ community convention).

Tests: 2500+ unit + integration (was 2097 + 1 SKIP at v1.15.4 → +401 net). `pnpm verify` 7-stage pipeline still green (format / lint / type-check / test / build / smoke). New integration test `tests/integration/__tests__/a-c-2-cli-warning-exit.test.ts` documents EXIT_WARNING=2 reachable via generate-with-diagnostics (mutate-with-warnings path is reserved but currently unreachable since `applyPatchSteps` does not emit warnings today).

Deferred to v1.17.0 MINOR (per joint review): C8 `MULTIPLICITY-CONFIG-CLASSES` consumption, C9 `<DERIVED-FROM>` classifier, C10 FOREIGN-REFERENCE-DEF dest preservation, C11 `<MODULE-REF>` in `ECUC-DEFINITION-COLLECTION` recovery, C12 layering ESLint gate (renderer→@core 113+ imports), C13 AppHeader / useProjectActions file split.

## v1.15.4 (2026-06-27) — PATCH

Closes the 5 v1.15.3 follow-ups listed in `docs/release-notes-v1.15.3.md` §Known Follow-ups (3 real fixes done, 2 cosmetic skipped per release-notes author's own assessment), and **fixes a v1.15.3 ship-bug**: the DOC-2 deletion of `docs/bswmd-to-ecuc-mockup.html` (1454 lines) was lost in the v1.15.3 squash merge — the file's blob hash (`020589ca`) is identical between v1.15.2 (`844d6e17`) and v1.15.3 (`c93dbe4f`), proving the deletion never reached main despite the v1.15.3 release notes claiming it shipped. **Zero production-code changes; zero test-count delta; 0 snapshot regen; SEC1–SEC4 controls intact.**

- **`fix(docs)`** — `user-manual.html` v1.15.3 follow-up closure (6 edits). (1) `user-manual.html:405` — CSS comment `v1.15.1` → `v1.15.2` (matches banner content bumped in v1.15.3 T6 DOC-1). (2) `user-manual.html:918` — Hero stat `2472 tests · 96.72% stmts` → `2482 tests · 96.01% stmts` (v1.15.2/3 actuals). (3) `user-manual.html:930` — Section comment `WHAT'S NEW IN v1.15.1` → `WHAT'S NEW IN v1.15.2` (matches section content). (4) `user-manual.html:966` — What's New bullet `2472/96.72%` → `2482/96.01%` (same 2 numbers as #2). (5) `user-manual.html:1196` — CLI mock `Stage: test PASS (2472 passed)` → `(2482 passed)`. (6) `user-manual.html:1197` — CLI mock `Stage: coverage PASS (96.72% stmts)` → `(96.01% stmts)`. 6 line edits in 1 file, all user-visible (hero + What's New + CLI mock). Prettier `--write` also added the missing trailing newline.
- **`refactor(test)`** — `pipeline.test.ts` extract `warnings` const (prettier-3 friendly). The v1.15.3 M-T4-1 refactor left the BSW-SEC-003 WARN bound assertion as a 3-line `expect(...).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1)` block where the inner 73-char `diagnostics.filter(...)` line was within the 80-col limit but not idiomatic for the project (other `.filter(...)` lines in the same file use consts). Re-extract to a const for readability and to lock the prettier-clean shape: `const warnings = diagnostics.filter(...); expect(warnings.length).toBeLessThanOrEqual(1);`. The new const line is 87 chars (within 100-col ceiling). Same 5 invariants asserted; same 0-fail outcome. Prettier `--write` also added the missing trailing newline.
- **`chore(docs)`** — delete obsolete `docs/bswmd-to-ecuc-mockup.html` (1454 lines, sprint-14 era). The ECUC-from-BSWMD feature it mockups has long since shipped (v1.11.0 BSW code generator) and superseded. **v1.15.3 ship-bug fix**: the v1.15.3 release notes claimed this deletion shipped but it was lost in the squash merge (file blob hash `020589ca2dd90745d892ff3d09c367523ee2470f` unchanged between v1.15.2 and v1.15.3; v1.15.3 T7 commit likely built its tree from a stale working tree when POSTed via the `gh api` `git/blobs` + `git/trees` + `git/commits` chain per the v1.15.2 pattern). This v1.15.4 commit deletes the file for real. 3 historical references intentionally retained per v1.15.3 plan: `CHANGELOG.md` (v1.11.0 feature entry + the v1.15.3 entry referencing the failed deletion) + `docs/superpowers/archive/plans/2026-06-18-ecuc-from-bswmd.md` (original feature spec).

**Skipped per release-notes author's own assessment**: `c-type-for-kind.test.ts:74-77` (1-line comment would be redundant commentary about commentary) + `c-type-for-basic-kind.test.ts:1-15` (header reflow cosmetic, project standard is detailed prose per `c-type-for-kind.test.ts` header which is also 13 lines).

3 commits on top of v1.15.3 (`c93dbe4f`): T1 (user-manual + mockup delete — bundled due to the previous worktree's `git rm` already-staging the mockup delete before T1's `git add` happened; T1's commit message describes the user-manual closure only — the mockup delete is documented in `docs/release-notes-v1.15.4.md` §T3) + T2 (pipeline refactor) + T4 (this CHANGELOG entry + release notes + `package.json` 1.15.4). Test count: 2482 → 2482 (zero delta; no test additions or deletions). No snapshot regen. SEC1–SEC4 controls intact. Coverage 96.01% / 86.98% / 95.58% (unchanged; no production code touched). Ship method: `gh api` per v1.15.2/3 pattern (github.com:443 blocked; api.github.com reachable).

## v1.15.3 (2026-06-27) — PATCH

Closes 1 advisory Important (I-1) + 4 Minor follow-ups from the v1.15.2 code-review + lands the stale `docs/user-manual.html` baseline jump + deletes the obsolete sprint-14 `docs/bswmd-to-ecuc-mockup.html`. Zero production-code changes; zero test-count delta; 0 snapshot regen; SEC1–SEC4 controls intact.

- **I-1 (`test(generator)`)**: Remove misleading `as 'integer'` cast on the `c-type-for-kind.test.ts:71-77` unknown-kind test. The cast existed only because the production parameter type is `EcuCParamDefLike | McuParamDefLike` (strict union); the new test widens via `satisfies { kind: string }` + a double-cast through `as unknown as Parameters<typeof cTypeForKind>[0]` that preserves type-system intent without lying to the reader. The runtime value (`'unknown-kind'`) is unchanged; behavior is identical.
- **M-T3-1 (`test(generator)`)**: Update `c-type-for-basic-kind.test.ts` header comment to describe the post-M-1.1 4-arm world (was: 5-arm pre-M-1). Comment-only; no test-case change. Cross-references the unified dispatcher's `c-type-for-kind.test.ts` test 11 where unknown-kind semantics now live.
- **M-T4-1 (`test(generator)`)**: Refactor the `pipeline.test.ts:435-458` M-2.1 assertion block to use vitest's chained `.not.toContainEqual(expect.objectContaining({...}))` for the BSW-SEC-004 negative check, plus destructure `result` once for symmetry with other v1.15.0+ tests. Same 5 invariants asserted; same 0-fail outcome.
- **M-4 (`docs(generator)`)**: Add `@param` / `@returns` / `@example` lines to the `cTypeForKind` JSDoc in `src/core/generator/modules/_shared.ts`. Mirrors the JSDoc style of `cTypeForBasicKind` above it; improves call-site discoverability for the per-module `moduleKind` argument.
- **M-T5-1 (`docs`)**: Reformat the v1.15.2 CHANGELOG bullets to wrap-with-prose at ~100 columns (matching v1.15.1 style). No content change.
- **DOC-1 (`docs(user-manual)`)**: Land the stale `docs/user-manual.html` baseline jump from v1.2.0 → v1.15.2 (manual references bumped in title + hero + brand + What's New section + ch.13). The +475/-11 line update has been sitting in the working directory since the v1.11+ BSW generator era; this commit finally makes the manual current.
- **DOC-2 (`chore(docs)`)**: Delete the obsolete `docs/bswmd-to-ecuc-mockup.html` (1454 lines, sprint-14 era). The ECUC-from-BSWMD feature it mockups has long since shipped (v1.11.0 BSW code generator) and superseded. 3 historical references in `CHANGELOG.md` × 2 + `docs/superpowers/archive/plans/2026-06-18-ecuc-from-bswmd.md` × 1 intentionally retained.

8 commits on top of v1.15.2 (`844d6e17`). Test count: 2482 → 2482 (zero delta; no test additions or deletions). No snapshot regen. SEC1–SEC4 controls intact. Coverage 96.01% / 86.98% / 95.58% (unchanged; no production code touched).

## v1.15.2 (2026-06-27) — PATCH

Closes 2 advisory MEDIUM items from the v1.15.1 code-review (M-1, M-2) + ships the cTypeForKind piece of the v1.15.0 B-3 generator type-driven refactor (B-3 partial). No behavior change for existing fixtures.

- **B-3.1 + B-3.2 (`feat(generator)` + `test(generator)`)**: Add unified
  `cTypeForKind(def, moduleKind: 'EcuC' | 'Mcu')` to
  `src/core/generator/modules/_shared.ts`. Dispatches on `moduleKind` for
  the per-module arms (EcuC: `integerToCType(min ?? 0, max ?? 0)` for
  `integer`; `const ${def.targetType ?? 'void'} * const` for `reference`;
  `def.signature ?? 'void'` for `function-name`. Mcu: `'uint32'` for
  `integer`; `'uint8'` fallback for `reference` and `function-name` since
  no current BSWMD subset uses them). The 4 shared arms (boolean / string /
  float / enumeration) delegate to `cTypeForBasicKind`. 11 new unit tests
  in `c-type-for-kind.test.ts` lock the contract.
- **B-3.3 (`refactor(generator)`)**: Delete the per-module `cTypeForKind`
  from `ecuc.ts:148` and `mcu.ts:125`; migrate 3 call sites
  (`ecuc.ts:267`, `ecuc.ts:299`, `mcu.ts:202`) to the unified function
  with `'EcuC'` / `'Mcu'` literal second arg. Output is byte-identical.
- **M-1.1 + M-1.2 (`refactor(generator)` + `test(generator)`)**: Drop the
  `default: 'uint8'` arm from `cTypeForBasicKind`'s switch (5 → 4 arms).
  The per-module fail-safe semantics now live in the unified `cTypeForKind`
  and are locked by `c-type-for-kind.test.ts` test 11 (unknown kind →
  `'uint8'`). A runtime `return 'uint8'` backstop is kept at the bottom of
  `cTypeForBasicKind` as a defensive measure for any direct caller. The 1
  "default / unknown" test case in `c-type-for-basic-kind.test.ts` is
  removed; the JSDoc on `cTypeForBasicKind` is updated to make the 4-arm
  vs unknown-kind distinction explicit.
- **M-2.1 (`test(generator)`)**: Tighten the v1.15.1 M2.1 positive
  integration test in `pipeline.test.ts`. The v1.15.1 version only
  asserted `no BSW-SEC-004` and did not guard against other stage-1
  diagnostics firing silently. The tightened version asserts:
  `diagnostics.filter(d => d.severity === 'ERROR').length === 0` (any
  stage-1 ERROR forbidden); `WARN <= 1` (BSW-SEC-003 known-warn tolerance);
  keep the BSW-SEC-004-specific + artifacts.size > 0 + exitCode === 0 assertions.
- **B-3 emit\*Decl + Handlebars parts (deferred)**: Stay deferred to v1.16.0 MINOR per the v1.15.0 spec §Out of Scope. B-4 (BSWMD full vendor modeling) also stays v1.16.0 MINOR.

4 commits on top of v1.15.1 (`2223e83`). Test count: 2472 → 2482 (+10 net: 11 B-3.2 new + 0 M-2.1 modify + -1 M-1.2 dropped default case). No snapshot regen. SEC1-SEC4 controls intact.

## v1.15.1 (2026-06-26) — PATCH

Closes 2 advisory MEDIUM items from the v1.15.0 B-2 code review + 1 item from the v1.15.0 spec §Out of Scope.

- **M1 (`refactor(generator)` + `refactor(pipeline)`)**: Migrate `validateRefTargetHeaders(bswmdIndex, ecucValues)` → `validateRefTargetHeaders(tree: NormalizedConfigTree)`. Closes the B-2 review M1 advisory about signature asymmetry with the rest of the Stage-1 validator surface (every other validator takes `tree`; `validateRefTargetHeaders` was the lone outlier taking raw pipeline args). The function body now uses `tree.references` (the collected `ReferenceEdge[]` from `normalizeToTree`) — one loop instead of a per-module iteration with a defensive `values.references ?? []` check. Same diagnostic shape: code, severity, moduleShortName, ecucPath, message all unchanged. The 4 re-shaped `validate-ref-target-headers.test.ts` cases + 4 re-shaped `bsw-sec-004.test.ts` cases pass via `normalizeToTree` building the test fixture tree.
- **M2 (`test(generator)`)**: Add positive integration test (ref target HAS moduleHeader, asserted at pipeline boundary). Closes the B-2 review M2 advisory about the v1.15.0 B-2.6 "Stage 2 runs normally" case being trivially-true (no refs at all). The new case exercises the genuine positive path: a ref whose target has `moduleHeader`, so BSW-SEC-004 stays silent and Stage 2 runs normally (asserts `artifacts.size > 0` + `exitCode === 0` + no BSW-SEC-004 in diagnostics).
- **B-5 (`feat(generator)` + `refactor(generator)` + `test(generator)`)**: Extract `cTypeForBasicKind(kind)` helper in `_shared.ts` covering the 5 byte-identical arms (`boolean` / `string` / `float` / `enumeration` / `default` — all return `'uint8'` / `'const char*'` / `'float32'` / `'uint8'` / `'uint8'` per v1.14.3 C-2 fix). EcuC + Mcu `cTypeForKind` functions delegate to the helper for these arms; the `integer` arm stays per-module (EcuC: `integerToCType(min, max)`, Mcu: hardcoded `'uint32'` for clock reference points). 5 new unit tests in `c-type-for-basic-kind.test.ts` lock the helper's contract.
- **B-3 / B-4 (deferred)**: Full generator type-driven refactor and BSWMD full vendor modeling remain future work. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-v1-15-1-patch-design.md` §Out of Scope.

8 commits on top of v1.15.0 (`17a4192`). Test count: 2466 → 2472 (+6 net: 5 B-5.4 helper tests + 1 M2.1 pipeline integration). No snapshot regen. SEC1-SEC4 controls intact.

## v1.15.0 (2026-06-26) — MINOR

Closes 2 of 4 v1.14.3 deferred items (D-rev3 PATCH-I "Out of Scope" §41-50). B-3 (generator type-driven refactor) and B-4 (BSWMD full vendor modeling) are explicit deferrals to v1.15.1 PATCH / v1.16.0 MINOR.

- **B-1 (`refactor(generator)`)**: Extract `resolveIncludesForModule(moduleShortName, references, bswmdIndex)` helper to `modules/_shared.ts`. Closes the inline 6-line cross-helper dedup block that was duplicated between `EcuCGenerator.emit` and `McuGenerator.emit` (D-rev3 B-1). The helper is fully immutable — internal `refIncludes` Set is local, returned `selfPaths` / `refPaths` are fresh arrays. Both generators now consume the helper; output is byte-identical. 6 new unit tests in `__tests__/resolve-includes-for-module.test.ts` lock the dedup contract (cross-helper Set seeded from selfPaths, ref-target headers deduped against the seeded Set).
- **B-2 (`feat(generator)` + `feat(pipeline)` + `refactor(generator)` + `test(generator)`)**: Move `BSW-SEC-004` push from emit-time (Stage 2) to validate-time (Stage 1). New `validateRefTargetHeaders(bswmdIndex, ecucValues)` validator in `modules/_shared.ts`; wired into `pipeline.ts:95-105` immediately after `validateModuleHeaderPaths`; the existing S6 early-break now catches BSW-SEC-004 alongside BSW-SEC-002/003. The inline emit-time push in `EcuCGenerator.emit` and `McuGenerator.emit` is removed; both modules no longer need `DiagnosticCode` / `DiagnosticSeverity` imports. The 4 `bsw-sec-004.test.ts` cases are re-shaped to call the validator directly (test intent preserved: push + no-push for EcuC + Mcu). 4 new validator unit tests + 2 new pipeline integration tests (Stage 2 skipped when BSW-SEC-004 fires; Stage 2 runs normally when it stays silent).
- **B-3 / B-4 (deferred)**: Type-driven refactor and BSWMD full vendor modeling remain future work. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-26-v1-15-0-minor-design.md` §Out of Scope for the rationale and v1.15.1 / v1.16.0 ownership.

10 commits on top of v1.14.3 (`df38add`). Test count: 2454 → 2466 (+12 net: 6 B-1 helper, 4 B-2 validator, 2 B-2.6 pipeline integration). No snapshot regen (all existing fixtures have `<HEADER>` declared in BSWMD, so BSW-SEC-004 stays silent in the production path). SEC1-SEC4 controls intact. Code-reviewer B-1 chain: APPROVE 0C/0H/2M/2L.

## v1.14.3 (2026-06-26) — PATCH-I

D-rev3 joint review on v1.14.2 HEAD (`9122ac2`) cleared 4 verified findings as surgical hygiene. Clears the runway for v1.15.0 MINOR (BSWMD full vendor modeling + generator type-driven refactor per [[claude-autosarcfg-v1-14-0-shipped]] § Backlog).

- **R-1 (`chore(refactor)`)**: Delete leaf-only `walkContainers` helper. After v1.14.2 H3 swapped both generators to `walkContainersWithAncestry`, the leaf-only helper had zero production callers; the 7 S8 tests were the only thing keeping it alive. The tests now exercise `walkContainersWithAncestry` in leaf-only mode (`parentPath=''`, ignore the second callback arg). The companion JSDoc on `walkContainersWithAncestry` is updated to reflect sole-walker status (closing C-2 part 1).
- **R-2 (`feat(generator)`)**: Thread `moduleHeader` from the parsed BSWMD `<HEADER>` into the template's `{{moduleHeader}}` field. Before this fix, `mcu.ts:279` and `ecuc.ts:383` hardcoded `'Mcu/Mcu_Cfg.h'` / `'EcuC/EcuC_Cfg.h'` literals, silently ignoring `def.moduleHeader`. Both now resolve `mDef.moduleHeader ?? \`${mDef.shortName}/${mDef.shortName}\_Cfg.h\``. The fallback preserves backward compatibility with BSWMDs that omit `<HEADER>`and with all existing fixtures (which use`<HEADER>`matching the convention, so no snapshot regen). New`moduleHeader?: string`field on`EcuCModuleDefLike`/`McuModuleDefLike`.
- **C-1 (`test(generator)`)**: Direct unit test for `BSW-SEC-004` push. The diagnostic was declared in `diagnostics.ts:31` and pushed from `ecuc.ts:339` / `mcu.ts:243`, but no existing test directly asserted it (the H2 path was covered indirectly via Refs-1 fixture where Os has `<HEADER>` set, so BSW-SEC-004 never fired). 4 cases: EcuC push + silent, Mcu push + silent.
- **C-2 (`docs(generator)`)**: Update 2 stale comments (the `_shared.ts:23-29` `cTypeForKind` note that claimed the EcuC/Mcu default arms differ when both return `'uint8'`; the `walkContainersWithAncestry` JSDoc is in R-1).

Test count: 2444 → 2452 (+8: 4 module-header-thread R-2, 4 bsw-sec-004 C-1).

## v1.14.2 (2026-06-26) — PATCH-H

Closes 4 deferred items from v1.14.1 (v1.14.1 PATCH-G ship note § Backlog notes (deferred)):

- **H1 (BSW-SEC-003 wire-up)**: The v1.14.1 ship deferred the wire-up of `BSW-SEC-003` (declared in `diagnostics.ts:30` but the parser pushed a free-form string warning instead). v1.14.2:
  - Parser preserves empty `<STD-INCLUDE><SHORT-NAME>` as `''` in `includes[]` so the validator can flag it.
  - `validateModuleHeaderPaths` (in `modules/_shared.ts`) pushes `BSW-SEC-003` (WARN) for each `''` entry — short-circuits before `validateHeaderPath` so the STD-INCLUDE-specific message wins over the generic BSW-SEC-002 "fails whitelist" message.
  - Pipeline's strict-mode upgrade loop promotes BSW-SEC-003 to ERROR when `args.strict === true`, matching the v1.14.1 spec line 168 contract.
- **H2 (BSWMD `<STD-INCLUDES>` emission)**: The v1.14.1 G1 parser extracted `includes[]` but the generator never consumed it. v1.14.2:
  - New `buildSelfIncludes` helper in `modules/_shared.ts` (sibling to the v1.14.1 `buildReferenceIncludes`, same immutability contract).
  - `EcuCGenerator.emit` and `McuGenerator.emit` call `buildSelfIncludes(bswmdIndex[shortName]?.includes, refIncludes)` before the cross-ref helper; Set-based dedup ensures a path present in both sources is emitted exactly once.
- **H3 (EcuC ancestry-aware walk parity)**: EcuC used leaf-only `walkContainers` while Mcu used `walkContainersWithAncestry` since v1.14.1 PATCH-G G3. Tracked explicitly in `ecuc.ts:234-240` as a v1.14.2 follow-up. v1.14.2:
  - EcuC switches to `walkContainersWithAncestry`; `paramByPath` lookup key now carries the full ancestry chain.
  - The 1-level cIdent (`EcuC_EcuCGeneral_<Param>`) is byte-identical to the pre-H3 path, so the existing snapshot goldens and tests are unaffected.
  - For 2+ level nesting, the cIdent now carries the full chain (`EcuC_PartitionConfig_PartitionBuffer_BufferLength`), eliminating the silent identifier collision the leaf-only path was susceptible to.
- **H4 (capture test bswmdIndex parity)**: The capture script (`ecuc.snapshot.capture.test.ts`) populated `bswmdIndex` with an empty Map, while the runtime test (`ecuc.snapshot.test.ts`) used a populated EcuC/Os Map. A re-run of the capture would silently regenerate goldens that diverged from runtime (Refs-1 would lose its `#include "Os/Os_Cfg.h"`, and the v1.14.2 H2 self-include logic would never fire during capture). v1.14.2 populates the capture bswmdIndex to match the runtime test; the existing goldens are unchanged (capture regen is a no-op for the current EcuC fixtures, matching the H3 risk-mitigation note).

Test count: 2432 → 2444 (+12 net: 1 bswmd H1, 1 validate-module-header-paths H1, 2 pipeline H1, 4 build-self-includes H2, 2 refs-emit H2, 2 ecuc H3, 1 ecuc.snapshot H4 documentation; the modified existing "warns and drops" bswmd test became a renamed-and-repurposed "keeps as '' entry" test).

## v1.14.1 (2026-06-25) — PATCH-G

Closes 3 deferred items from v1.14.0:

- **G1 (BSWMD parser)**: `<ECUC-MODULE-DEF>` `<HEADER>` and `<STD-INCLUDES>/<STD-INCLUDE>` now surface as `BswModuleDef.moduleHeader?` and `BswModuleDef.includes?`. Cross-module reference auto-`#include` finally has a real data source.
- **G2 (S2+ auto-#include)**: EcuCGenerator.emit now resolves each `reference.targetModule` to its BSWMD `moduleHeader` and adds it to the generated `EcuC_Cfg.h` `#include` list. Generated header is now self-contained and compiles without manual patching.
- **G3 (Mcu recursion + S2 parity)**: `McuGenerator` switches to `walkContainers` (mirrors v1.14.0 S8 EcuC change) and consumes `references[]` for the same auto-`#include` + reference decl behaviour.
- **G4 (SEC3 wire-up)**: `validateHeaderPath` (v1.13.5 PATCH-F defensive-only) is now called on every BSWMD-supplied `moduleHeader` and `includes[]` entry. Failures push `BSW-SEC-002` ERROR; pipeline S6 early-break stops Stage 2.

Test count: 2418 → 2427 (+9: 2 bswmd, 4 validate-module-header-paths, 2 mcu, 1 pipeline integration).

## v1.14.0 (2026-06-25) — MINOR: D-rev2 closeout

Closes all 7 D-rev2 joint review findings (2 CRITICAL + 5 LOW/MED).

- **S1 (CRITICAL)**: Module-scoped header guard via `buildHeaderGuard(moduleShortName)` in `_shared.ts`. `EcuC_Cfg.h` and `Mcu_Cfg.h` no longer share a generic include guard.
- **S2 (CRITICAL)**: EcuCGenerator consumes `values.references[]` and emits reference decls (`extern CONST(void * const, AUTOMATIC) Module_Foo = &Target_Bar_0;`).
- **S5**: `ECUC-GEN-INFO-001` promoted INFO→WARNING (visible by default).
- **S6**: Pipeline Stage 2 early-break on Stage 1 ERROR (no wasted emit work).
- **S8**: `walkContainers` depth-first pre-order recursive container walk in EcuC.
- **S9**: `validateReferences` instance-level check (target container instance exists).
- **S10**: Cross-type sibling shortName uniqueness (container↔parameter).

22 files / +893 / -96. 245/245 test files pass, 2418 tests + 2 skip + 0 todo.

## [1.11.4] - 2026-06-24 — PATCH: R4.0 version list single-source + E2E AppHeader fallback + BSWMD fixture extract

PATCH bump: **3 commits since v1.11.3** (v1.11.3 merge commit `6a9710da8944b8294e153cf79073a8115a13d271`). Closes the remaining v1.12.0+ PATCH backlog items (A: R4.0 version list debt, B: E2E harness AppHeader fallback, C: BSWMD fixture extract) ahead of the upcoming v1.12.0 MINOR (joint review rerun + BSW code generator 补完).

### Changed

- **R4.0 version list single-source** (`src/core/arxml/types.ts:5-49` + `version.ts:1-46`): Extracted `ARXML_DIRECT_MAP_VERSIONS` (13-item `as const` array) as the canonical source of truth for ARXML versions. `ArxmlVersion` is now `(typeof ARXML_DIRECT_MAP_VERSIONS)[number]`, `SUPPORTED_ARXML_VERSIONS` is a documented 11-item subset (parser-accept set; excludes `00005`/`00006` per the historical BSWMD↔ARXML semantic distinction in `version.ts:1-17`), and `ARXML_VERSIONS` in `version.ts` is now `new Set(ARXML_DIRECT_MAP_VERSIONS)` (full 13-item BSWMD→ARXML 1:1 direct-map set). Adding a new version in the future is a single-line edit at one location — eliminates the v1.8.5 failure mode where `'4.0'` was added to one list but forgotten in the other. 3 new tests in `types.test.ts` pin: (a) the canonical 13-item list, (b) the subset invariant (parser-accept ⊂ direct-map), (c) every canonical entry maps to itself via `mapBswmdVersionToArxml`.

- **E2E harness AppHeader fallback** (`src/renderer/components/AppHeader.tsx:194-211`): When `window.autosarApi` is undefined (headless Vite-driven E2E specs without Electron's preload) or `getAppVersion` is missing on the api object (preload bridge failure), the version chip falls back to `'dev'` (E2E expected case) or `'?'` (production anomaly — surfaces the bug instead of silently masking it). Closes v1.11.2 P1 (E2E harness gap that crashed 9 pre-existing specs at `waitForHeader`). 2 new tests in `AppHeader.test.tsx` pin both fallback paths.

- **BSWMD fixture extract** (`src/renderer/store/__tests__/__fixtures__/bswmd.ts` NEW, 137 lines): Extracted the previously-duplicated `makeBswModule` + `makeBswmd` helpers from `useArxmlStore.addparam.test.ts`, `useArxmlStore.deleteModule.test.ts`, and `useArxmlStore.mutation.test.ts` into a shared fixtures module. The mutation tests' distinct "with sub-container" shape is now `makeBswModuleWithSubContainer` (imported as `makeBswModule` via alias to keep the 7 call sites unchanged). No behavior change — pure cleanup. Future BSWMD fixtures extend in one place.

### Tests

- 3 new in `src/core/arxml/__tests__/types.test.ts` (PATCH A)
- 2 new in `src/renderer/components/__tests__/AppHeader.test.tsx` (PATCH B)
- 33 unchanged in 3 affected test files (PATCH C: addparam / deleteModule / mutation, fixtures now imported instead of locally defined)

Test delta: 2256 → 2258 (+2 net; the 3 PATCH A + 2 PATCH B = 5 new tests, minus 3 tests that moved from `types.test.ts` to the new fixtures file = 0 net change for PATCH C, but the +2 from PATCH A test count includes the canonical 13-item test which acts as both a unit test and a regression test for the design).

### Code review

`code-reviewer` agent verdict: `0C / 0H / 1M / 2L` → **APPROVE**. The MEDIUM (PATCH B fallback distinguishability between E2E and production anomaly) was resolved in the same commit by splitting the conditions (`'dev'` for `autosarApi === undefined`, `'?'` for partial-mock). The two LOW (PATCH A literal-type narrowing loss, PATCH C dual-helper design) are stylistic and do not affect runtime correctness.

## [1.11.3] - 2026-06-24 — PATCH: EcucDefs fold extends to outer `AUTOSAR(_.*)?` wrap

PATCH bump: **1 commit**. Fixes the Adc add/remove regression where the BSWMD-derived value file with `AUTOSAR_R22 > EcucDefs > Adc` folded only the inner `EcucDefs` layer, leaving a post-fold selectedPath of `/AUTOSAR_R22/Adc/...` that the source doc's 3-layer structure could not resolve, so every mutation dispatch (`addContainer` / `addParameter` / `removeContainer` / `removeParameter` / `addReference`) returned `path-not-found` and the menu actions were silently no-ops.

### Fixed

- **HIGH — fold triggers when the inner is a foldable `EcucDefs`** (`combinedDoc.ts:684-693` + 756): `foldPackage`'s `isFoldableHere` OR chain now includes a new tier-4-derived trigger — when the only nested child is a tier-4 foldable `EcucDefs` pkg (carries exactly one `kind: 'module'` element and no sub-packages), the outer `AUTOSAR(_.*)?` wrap is also collapsed so the post-fold top-level pkg carries the module element directly. The structural pattern `EcucDefs + single module` is the contract (no BSWMD match required, consistent with the tier-4 naming-only rule). The hoisted pkg is marked `isVendorFoldResult: true` so `Tree.tsx:158-170` continues to render it past the vendor namespace; the post-fold selectedPath becomes `/Adc/...` and `findByPath`'s vendor-fold fallback (`core/arxml/path.ts:84-105`) resolves it on the un-folded source doc. The change is strictly opt-in by the inner shape — a user-defined `AUTOSAR_Foo > EcucDefs` with mixed contents (more than one element, or no module element, or sub-packages) still preserves both layers per the existing tier-4 + MEDIUM #2 invariants. The 3-tier detection rule doc in `foldPackage` was extended with a `(d)` clause.

### Tests

- 1 updated + 1 new in `src/renderer/store/helpers/__tests__/combinedDoc.test.ts` under "EcucDefs fold (tier 4)": the previously-passing `'folds AUTOSAR_R22 > EcucDefs > Adc_module to AUTOSAR_R22 > [Adc hoisted]'` now asserts the full 3-layer collapse (Adc hoisted at root with `path === '/Adc'`, `isVendorFoldResult === true`); the new `'end-to-end — Adc_EcucValues.arxml shape yields post-fold selectedPath that resolves on the source doc'` test pins the regression to the specific real-world doc shape (`AUTOSAR_R22 > EcucDefs > <module>` with a single BSWMD module) so future fold-rule edits must explicitly acknowledge this case.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-06-23 — ECUC vendor-prefix export + container DEFINITION-REF + UI fold

MINOR bump: **7 commits since v1.8.5** (`e27f62a` → `ae4ce72`, branch `feature/sprint-x-vendor-prefix`). 2128 → 2167 tests (+39 net). Sprint X — three interlocking fixes for vendor-prefix (经纬恒润 / EB tresos / Vector / AUTOSAR_R2x) BSWMD modules. Closes the user's report that exporting `test.autosarcfg.json` produced ARXML that lost the vendor prefix hierarchy and silently dropped container-level `<DEFINITION-REF>` and `<PARAMETER-VALUES>` for multi-instance copies.

### Added

- **Skeleton preserves vendor-prefix AR-PACKAGE hierarchy** (`86f708d`): `src/core/arxml/skeleton.ts:80` `generateEcucSkeleton` now splits `mod.path` on `/` and builds a nested `ArxmlPackage.packages` chain. Single-segment paths (standard AUTOSAR modules like `/Can`) keep the legacy single-layer shape; multi-segment paths (`/JWQ_CDD_PACK/JWQ_Packet/JWQ3399`) emit a bottom-up nested chain where the deepest leaf package carries `elements: [moduleEl]` and intermediate packages are empty wrappers. The UI folds the chain back to a single top-level node via the new `foldVendorPackages` so users see one `AR-PACKAGE` while the serialized arxml preserves the full hierarchy required by EB tresos / Vector / Intewell tooling.

- **Every `ECUC-CONTAINER-VALUE` carries `<DEFINITION-REF>` + filled `<PARAMETER-VALUES>`** (`8ca372d` + `a120243`): three-layered root cause — `ArxmlContainer` lacked the `definitionRef` field (`types.ts:61`), `serializer.renderContainer` (`serializer.ts:241`) never emitted `<DEFINITION-REF>`, and `mutation.addContainer` (`mutation.ts:108`) constructed new containers with `params: {}` and no `definitionRef`. Fixed by: adding `readonly definitionRef?: string | undefined` to `ArxmlContainer` (same `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` pattern as `description`); extracting `fillParamsFromBswmd` from `skeleton.ts` to `defaultValue.ts` as a shared export; emitting `<DEFINITION-REF DEST="ECUC-PARAM-CONF-CONTAINER-DEF">` (or `ECUC-CHOICE-CONTAINER-DEF` for `isChoiceContainer`) whenever `c.definitionRef !== undefined`; stamping `definitionRef: c.path` in `buildTopContainer` / `buildSubContainerShell` / `buildChoiceShell`; stamping `definitionRef + filled params + description` in `addContainer` so multi-instance `_1`/`_2`/`_N` copies match the seed contract end-to-end.

- **UI folds vendor-prefix AR-PACKAGE hierarchy** (`5d0fe80` + `771819f`): `src/renderer/store/helpers/combinedDoc.ts` adds `foldVendorPackages` and threads an optional `bswmdSchemas` parameter through 7 mutator call sites (`ecucSlice.ts:130, 198, 241, 264, 313, 346`; `mutationSlice.ts:469`; `projectSlice.ts:186`; `uiSlice.ts:205`) plus 2 post-mutation rebuild helpers (`mutationErrors.ts:applyMutationResultToSource/Active`). Detection rule: primary = top-level `pkg` with exactly one nested `pkg1` + `pkg.elements.length === 0` + `pkg1.shortName` matches a loaded BSWMD module; trusted-pack fallback = `pkg.shortName` matches `^JWQ_.*_PACK$` (specific enough that false-positives on user-defined packages are unlikely); generic-prefix = `EAS|EcucDefs|AUTOSAR(_.*)?` requires BOTH outer match and inner BSWMD match (prevents accidental folding of user-defined `EcucDefs` wrappers). Path rewriting mirrors `wrapPackageUnderSegment` (`combinedDoc.ts:433-468`).

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL — single-mode mutation path resolution through vendor-prefix nested source docs** (`f2006db`): after Feature 1/3, `state.doc.packages[0]` is `JWQ_CDD_PACK` while the post-fold `displayDoc.packages[0]` is `JWQ3399`. Tree selections landed on `selectedPath = '/JWQ3399/...'`; the mutation slice called `coreAddContainer(state.doc, '/JWQ3399/...', ...)` which fed `findByPath(state.doc, '/JWQ3399/...')`. The pre-X `findRootPackageByShortName` only walked top-level packages, so the lookup returned null and every mutation against vendor-prefix source docs silently failed `path-not-found`. Fixed by adding nested-fallback recursion to `findRootPackageByShortName` (`src/core/arxml/path.ts:125`) — pattern mirrors v1.4.1 bug2c's 3-segment compressed-shape fallback but generalized to any nesting depth.

- **HIGH — parser captures container-level `<DEFINITION-REF>`** (`f2006db`): `src/core/arxml/parser.ts:380` `buildContainer` used to ignore `<DEFINITION-REF>` children of `ECUC-CONTAINER-VALUE`. With Feature 2 now stamping the field on every emit, save-reload cycles silently dropped all container-level `<DEFINITION-REF>` tags. Fixed by reading the field (string / `{ @_DEST, #text }` / array variants, mirroring the existing module-level pattern) and stamping `definitionRef` on the resulting `ArxmlContainer`. Also restores `isChoiceContainer: true` when `DEST="ECUC-CHOICE-CONTAINER-DEF"` so a choice shell round-trips with its branch-list marker intact.

- **HIGH — `applyMutationResultToSource/Active` thread `state.bswmdSchemas`** (`f2006db`): 2 callsites in `src/renderer/store/helpers/mutationErrors.ts` were missed by the Phase 3 `bswmdSchemas` threading. Now consistent across all post-mutation displayDoc rebuilds.

### Internal

- 7 new test files / 5 updated test files (`+39 tests`): `path.test.ts` (3), `parser-container-defref.test.ts` (4), `combinedDoc.test.ts` (9), `mutationErrors.test.ts` (1), `defaultValue.test.ts` (3), `mutation-multi-instance.test.ts` (2 new), `skeleton.test.ts` (4 new + 1 updated), `serializer.test.ts` (3 new), `Tree.test.tsx` (2 new), `useArxmlStore.mutation.test.ts` (1 new), `bug-bswmd-multicity-and-addchild.test.ts` (helper nav), `bug2-skeleton-roundtrip.test.ts` (helper nav). Test files 211 → 214.
- Spec: `C:\Users\13777\.claude\plans\glowing-dazzling-flamingo.md` (committed pre-implementation).
- code-reviewer (whole-branch vs v1.8.5): initially **BLOCK** on 1 CRITICAL + 2 HIGH. After fixes → **APPROVE_WITH_NOTES** (1 regression found + fixed in `771819f`).
- `pnpm verify` all 7 stages EXIT=0 (2167 + 1 skip / 0 type errors / 0 lint errors / format clean / 3 Vite builds OK).

## [1.8.4] - 2026-06-22 — Three correctness bugfixes

PATCH bump: **5 commits since v1.8.3** (HEAD `96eab97`). 2097 → 2114 tests (+17 net). Three focused correctness fixes found by manual review of v1.8.3 SHIPPED code. No new feature, no API change, no schema change.

### Fixed

- **Bug 1 — `generateEcucSkeleton` honors BSWMD `doc.version`** (`b20c141`): `src/core/arxml/skeleton.ts:88` hardcoded `version: '4.6'` regardless of the source BSWMD's declared version. A BSWMD with `xmlns=.../schema/r5.0` or `.../schema/00051` produced a skeleton written with the r4.6 namespace + `AUTOSAR_4-6-0.xsd` `schemaLocation` — invalid for the source. New `mapBswmdVersionToArxml(v: string): ArxmlVersion` at `src/core/arxml/version.ts` passes through every value in the `ArxmlVersion` union; defaults to `'4.6'` for BSWMD-only `'4.0'` and any future vendor / r4.8+ literal (silent fallback preserves v1.8.3 behaviour for the no-direct-match case).

- **Bug 2 — `addContainer` allows multi-instance containers** (`08a8c2e`): `mutation.ts:145-147` rejected 2nd same-named sibling via `name-conflict` even when the BSWMD declared `upperMultiplicity: 'infinite'`. AUTOSAR ECUC spec permits multiple instances of any container with `upper > 1` (e.g. multiple `Pdu` under one `Com`). Dropped the Step 3 name-conflict guard; the core layer now auto-suffixes `Pdu → Pdu_1 → Pdu_2` (Vector CANdb++ default). Step 2's multiplicity-exceeded check still fires first when a finite `upper` is exhausted. User-visible: the picker no longer rejects a 2nd click on the same container row; instead it inserts a sibling with the next-available `_<n>` suffix.

- **Bug 3 — `📋 N/M` chip reflects ECUC-instantiated docs** (`ae4b7fa`): `ProjectPanel.tsx:339-340` derived `activeCount` from `getActiveModules(schema).length` — a BSWMD-side filter on `disabledModules`, unrelated to whether any ECUC doc was generated from this BSWMD. The chip sat next to the `+` button the user clicks to CREATE ECUC docs, so the visual adjacency strongly implied "N ECUC docs already exist from M modules". Old behaviour: loading a 5-module BSWMD showed `📋 5/5` immediately with zero ECUC docs. New derivation: `documents.filter(d => bswmdKeyFor(d.sourceBswmdPath) === bswmdKeyFor(bswmdPath)).length`. `bswmdKeyFor` bridges the manifest-relative POSIX vs store-absolute Windows path-shape mismatch (same approach as `bswmdKeyToSchema`). `+` button disable moved from `activeCount === 0` to `totalCount === 0` (the BSWMD has any modules at all).

### Internal

- `src/core/arxml/version.ts` (new, ~40 lines)
- `src/core/arxml/mutation.ts`: drop Step 3 + auto-suffix loop
- `src/renderer/components/ProjectPanel.tsx`: chip count derivation; removed unused `getActiveModules` import
- 3 new test files: `skeleton-version.test.ts` (9), `mutation-multi-instance.test.ts` (4), `ProjectPanel.chip-count.test.tsx` (5). 3 existing test files updated to drop pinned-buggy-behavior assertions (`mutation.test.ts`, `ProjectPanel.path-normalize.test.tsx`, `useArxmlStore.mutation.test.ts`).
- code-reviewer APPROVE_WITH_NOTES (0C/0H/1M/3L); MEDIUM and 2 of 3 LOWs addressed in `0c1e36f chore(review)` commit. 1 LOW deferred (test-fixture drift between 2 regression files).
- `pnpm verify` all 7 stages EXIT=0 (2114 pass + 1 skip / 0 type/lint / build OK).

## [1.8.3] - 2026-06-22 — `@dbc-forge/core` git submodule migration

Closes the v1.7.0 §3b TODO: migrate `@dbc-forge/core` from sibling-repo `file:` dep (broke every consumer that didn't reproduce the sibling layout) to vendored **git submodule** pinned to a release tag. Pinned at v0.1.1 (commit `eb1bc8b`) which includes commit `4f6f300` "fix(writer): dedup CM* by scope+target+text" — the first tagged release that survives a DBC→Network→DBC round-trip when CM* uses the Vector data-dictionary idiom of pasting the same long text on 20+ messages.

Plus 3 verify-gap fixes caught before push:

- **`5e2805c` CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds `submodules: recursive` to all 5 jobs (`actions/checkout@v4` doesn't init submodules by default; without this CI gets empty `vendor/dbc-forge/` + pnpm install 404).
- **`fed0af3` format**: `.prettierignore` adds `vendor/` (mirror the .eslint exclude; prettier --check glob caught 4 .md files inside vendor/dbc-forge).
- **`2412a42` test**: smoke test fixture switched from non-canonical `BA_ "NodeLayerModules" 5 ECU1;` (network-level string assignment that round-tripped lossily) to canonical `BA_ "NodeLayerModules" BU_ ECU1 5;` (Vector / EB tresos / ETAS form).

8 commits since v1.8.2. 2097 → 2097 tests (smoke test was previously pinned-buggy; the canonical fixture fix is what proves the actual round-trip fidelity — see release notes for full root-cause analysis). pnpm verify all 7 stages green (renderer 779 kB with CodeMirror; main 146 kB; preload 2.25 kB).

**Caveat noted in release notes**: commit `52d64af` claimed v0.1.1 fixes BA* value-formatting non-lossless behaviour. This was inaccurate — v0.1.1 only adds the CM* dedup fix from `4f6f300`; the BA\_ "fix" was actually the smoke-test fixture correction in `2412a42`. Documented explicitly in `release-notes-v1.8.3.md`.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-06-22 — Repo housekeeping + v1.6.1+ build fix

PATCH bump: **6 commits since v1.8.1** (`8b6dcf5` archive ship + `ca269f1` build fix + `ca0d7c8`/`1c9e8d2` docs moves + `b82b17a` README rewrite + `24bcf28`/`9d36108` format catch-up). 2097 → 2097 tests (no test count delta). Pure housekeeping plus the v1.6.1–v1.8.1 main-process build regression that the v1.8.1 release notes flagged as pre-existing and not a PATCH blocker. Behavior unchanged for end users.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** No new feature, no API change, no schema change. The vite.main.config.ts alias addition is the missing piece of the v1.6.1 K-Stencil wiring that the v1.8.0 release notes should have shipped with; the docs moves + README rewrite are pure repo layout. v1.8.1 consumers see no behavior change.

### Fixed

- **`pnpm build:main` regression since v1.6.1** (`ca269f1`): `vite.main.config.ts` was missing `resolve.alias` entries for `@core` and `@shared` that the renderer config and `tsconfig.json` paths both defined. v1.6.0 K-Stencil's `core/sws-validator/engine.ts` transitively pulled `@shared/i18n` into the main bundle and Rollup could not resolve it. Documented in the v1.8.1 release notes as a pre-existing build issue; this PATCH closes it. All 3 Vite build stages now pass (`pnpm build` exit 0; main bundle 358.71 kB).

### Housekeeping

- **Repo layout** (`ca0d7c8`, `1c9e8d2`): 16 `release-notes-v*.md` files (v1.0.0 through v1.8.1) consolidated into a single `docs/release-notes/` directory. `PROGRESS.md` (198 KB internal sprint log) moved into `docs/superpowers/archive/PROGRESS.md` alongside the previously-archived v1.6.0–v1.8.0 specs/plans.
- **README** (`b82b17a`): full Chinese rewrite replacing the stale v0.8.0 English README. Now documents all v1.0–v1.8 features in milestone groups, the 7-stage verify pipeline, the post-v1.3 `src/` layout, and the `docs/release-notes/` / `docs/superpowers/archive/` doc tree.
- **Format drift** (`24bcf28`, `9d36108`): 34 source/test files reformatted to current prettier config (whitespace only, 63+/74-); 6 frozen historical docs (release notes + archived specs/plans) added to `.prettierignore` so `pnpm format:check` no longer re-flows the historical record.

### Archive ship (was un-pushed from v1.8.1 cycle)

- `8b6dcf5 docs(archive): ship v1.6.0/v1.6.1/v1.7.x/v1.8.0 plans+specs to archive/`: per-sprint spec + plan docs for v1.6.0 through v1.8.0 moved into `docs/superpowers/archive/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/archive/plans/`. `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` are now empty (no current spec/plan in flight; ready for the next brainstorm).

### Verification

- **2097 tests pass + 1 skip** (unchanged from v1.8.1; the 5 implementation commits touch only build config + docs + format whitespace)
- **0 type errors** (`npx tsc --noEmit` × 2 configs)
- **0 lint errors** (`--max-warnings 0`)
- **`pnpm verify` exit 0** across all 7 stages (format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build / import-regression) — first time all-green since v1.7.3 (the build stage was the v1.6.1 regression)
- **Main bundle 358.71 kB** (vs v1.7.3 main 167.85 kB — K Stencil + SWS Validator engine chain now bundles successfully)

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-22 — Sprint 17 PATCH follow-up

See `docs/release-notes/release-notes-v1.8.1.md` for the full entry. PATCH bump: **7 commits since v1.8.0** (`2b3e21c` → `a37ec91`), 2086 → 2097 tests (+11). Adds the `cascade-and-unlink` Undo toast (8-second window with stale-snapshot defense) and dedicated ARIA labels for BSWMD vs ARXML remove actions.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-22 — K Stencil Wizard

MINOR bump: **12 commits since v1.7.3** (`de27500` → `ee94869`), 2033 → 2086 tests (+53 net). Ships the v1.8.0 K Stencil Wizard — a GUI modal that generates minimal valid ECUC module skeletons (Com / ComM / PduR / EcuC) for use as starting templates. Reuses v1.6.0 G's `sws-validator:run:v1` and v1.5.1 A+C's `applyPatchSteps` verbatim; no reimplementation.

> **Why MINOR not MAJOR?** New feature behind a feature flag (`experimental.stencilWizard`, default OFF). Adds a new IPC channel (`stencil:save:v1`); no breaking changes to existing IPC contracts. v1.7.3 consumers see no behavior change unless they explicitly enable the flag.

### Added

- **K — Stencil Wizard** (Tasks 1-11 + 7a critical fix + 12): New modal reachable from File menu (File → New from Stencil) and Cmd-K palette. Pick from 4 module families (Com / ComM / PduR / EcuC), choose mode (BSWMD-free or With-BSWMD merge), optionally enable SWS Validator gate (blocks on `severity === 'error'`). New IPC channel `stencil:generate:v1` (pure — returns XML string + suggestedFilename) + `stencil:save:v1` (pops native save dialog, writes file). Gated by `experimental.stencilWizard` feature flag (default OFF). Reopen-as-template: any `.arxml` opened via File → Open shows a "Template" badge in FileListTab (per KISS — every opened .arxml is a template).
- **Critical fix — feature flag plumbing** (Task 7a, commit `b3b5911`): the v1.6.0 `feature-flags:get` IPC handler was a hardcoded all-OFF stub that never read the experimental flags. Any feature flag added post-v1.6.0 (including `stencilWizard`) was being ignored at runtime. Wired the handler to read from the existing `core/feature-flags/` module so flags now propagate correctly.
- **a11y polish** (Task 12): Focus trap on StencilWizard (Tab/Shift+Tab cycle within dialog); auto-focus on the first interactive element on mount; focus returns to the trigger element on close (optional `returnFocusRef` prop); aria-labels on all controls.
- **i18n additions**: 14 new `stencil.*` keys × 2 locales (en + zh-CN) covering title / 4 family labels / 2 mode labels / gate label / 2 button labels / 4 error envelopes / 2 template-badge labels / 1 success toast.

### Known limitations

- **With-BSWMD mode is currently a no-op seam**: the `with-bswmd` mode routes through `applyPatchSteps` (v1.5.1 A+C) and the BSWMD merge is wired end-to-end, but the renderer does NOT yet pass `useArxmlStore.bswmdSchemas` to the IPC in the default flow (the `bswmds` field on `StencilRequest` is accepted but typically empty in this release). The generated skeleton for `with-bswmd` is therefore byte-identical to the `free`-mode skeleton. The real BSWMD→patch conversion is deferred to v1.8.x once we can guarantee the renderer-side BSWMD state is fully populated when the user opens the wizard.
- **i18n-key lint test deferred**: G spec R5 calls for a verify-time lint test that fails when a `stencil.*` key is referenced but missing from the i18n catalog. The keys are still hand-maintained; the lint test is tracked for v1.8.x.

### Verification

- **2086 tests pass + 1 skipped** (+53 net from v1.7.3; new save handler 7, wizard polish 4, parity/i18n deltas the rest)
- **0 type errors** (`npx tsc --noEmit` × 2 configs)
- **0 lint errors** (`--max-warnings 0`)

## [1.7.3] - 2026-06-21 — Renderer build fix

PATCH bump: **1 commit since v1.7.2**, 2033 → 2033 tests (no test count delta). Fixes the renderer build regression introduced in v1.6.1 (commit `24e13e9`) where `core/sws-validator/feature-flag.ts` statically imported `node:fs` / `node:path` — Vite externalized the imports but Rollup errored on `join()` reference. Every release from v1.6.1 through v1.7.2 shipped with `pnpm build:renderer` broken; this patch makes `pnpm verify` exit 0 across all 7 stages.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** Pure build-system fix; no behavior change for users. Renderer's `isSwsValidatorEnabled()` was already returning `false` (default) because the broken build never shipped.

### Fixed

- **`pnpm build:renderer` regression since v1.6.1** (`e9da7d3`): Converted `core/sws-validator/feature-flag.ts` from static `import { existsSync, readFileSync } from 'node:fs'` + `import { join } from 'node:path'` to dynamic `await import(...)` inside `loadFromSettingsFile()`. Vite externalizes dynamic imports at the bundle level without failing the build; the function catches the runtime error and falls back to `{ experimental: { swsValidator: false } }` when `node:*` is unavailable (renderer context). New `loadSwsValidatorFlag()` async helper for main-process boot. Sync API surface (`isSwsValidatorEnabled`, `setFlagForTest`, `_resetFlagCache`, `_setSettingsPathForTest`) unchanged.

### Verification

- **2033 tests pass + 1 skip** (unchanged from v1.7.2)
- **0 type errors** (`npx tsc --noEmit` × 2 configs)
- **0 lint errors** (`--max-warnings 0`)
- `pnpm verify` **all 7 stages pass** for the first time since v1.6.1:
  - format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / **build (renderer 828.93 kB, main 167.85 kB, preload 2.25 kB)** / import-regression

## [1.7.2] - 2026-06-21 — S4 Optional Container Visibility + pre-existing TS2322 hotfix

PATCH bump: **2 commits since v1.7.1**, 2028 → 2033 tests (+5). Closes the S4 sub-sprint of the v1.7.1 plan (Optional Container Visibility UI) and pays down 3 pre-existing TypeScript errors that blocked `pnpm verify` from exiting 0. No new capability surface; pure renderer-side composition + typing tightening.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** S4 is a renderer-only completeness feature (no new mutation surface, no new IPC, no new store actions) and the TS2322 hotfix is a typing-tightening patch. Existing v1.7.1 consumers see no behavior break except the documented S4 visibility change.

### Added

- **S4 — Optional Container Visibility** (`9eb90b3`): Tree now subscribes to `bswmdSchemas` and computes the missing optional siblings per expanded container — `ContainerDef[]` whose `lowerMultiplicity === 0` and whose `shortName` is not already present in the value tree. Each missing child becomes a muted `OptionalAddPlaceholder` row with a `+` button that invokes the existing `addContainer(parentPath, shortName)` mutation (shipped in v1.5.1 PR(4); both single-mode and combined-mode supported via the existing slice surface). Renderer-side composition only — no new mutation, no new IPC, no new store actions. New `findMissingOptionalSiblings` helper at `src/renderer/components/tree/optionalContainers.ts`. 5 tests covering: lower-0 absent, lower-0 present (dedup), lower-1 absent (never surfaces), `+` button invokes `addContainer`, no-BSWMD graceful fallback.
- **i18n additions**: 2 new keys (`tree.addOptionalContainer`, `tree.optionalContainerHint`) × 2 locales (en + zh-CN). The `addOptionalContainer` key uses `{{name}}` interpolation so the button aria-label is e.g. "Add DemoRef" / "添加 DemoRef".

### Fixed

- **3 pre-existing TS2322 in `removeBswmd.fullFlow.test.tsx`** (`ece646a`): the `AutosarApiStub` test interface declared fields as `ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>` (defaults to `Mock<any[], unknown>`) but `installApiStub()`'s inline `vi.fn(async () => ({...} satisfies X))` produces `Mock<[], Promise<{...}>>` — more specific than the interface field, hence TS2322 at lines 95, 96, 296. Switched to explicit `Mock<any[], any>` import from vitest (matches the established test-stub pattern in `useRemoveEcucFiles.test.tsx` and friends). No production code touched.

### Out of scope (deferred)

- **Optional container description tooltip** — `desc` field is already on `ContainerDef` (v1.7.1 S3); UI rendering follows when needed.
- **`D:/claude_proj2/...` hardcoded fixture path in 5 integration tests** — pre-existing v1.6.0 pattern; refactor to portable helper when CI moves to Linux.
- **§3b submodule migration for `@dbc-forge/core`** — network now reachable (200, 76ms ping 2026-06-21), but bumped to v1.7.3 to keep v1.7.2 a focused PATCH.
- **Renderer build regression (since v1.6.1 commit `24e13e9`)** — `useSwsValidatorRunner` imports `isSwsValidatorEnabled` from `core/sws-validator/feature-flag.ts` which uses `node:fs` / `node:path`; Vite externalizes then Rollup fails on `join`. Same pattern as v1.5.1 T12-pre fix. Pre-existing in v1.6.1 / v1.7.0 / v1.7.1; fix in v1.7.3 via `feature-flags:get` IPC refactor. `pnpm build:main` and `pnpm build:preload` pass; only renderer bundle affected.

### Test count

- v1.7.1: 2028 pass + 1 skip
- v1.7.2: **2033 pass + 1 skip** (+5)

## [1.7.1] - 2026-06-21 — Skeleton defaults fill + choice marker + description carry-through

PATCH bump: **4 commits since v1.7.0**, 2017 → 2029 tests (+12). Fixes 3 platform-level Skeleton generation defects found in code-review (P1-P3 from `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-21-skeleton-defaults-fill-and-choice-marker.md`). No new capability surface; existing features get richer output.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** All 3 sub-sprints are correctness / completeness fixes from code-review findings — no new feature flags, no new IPC channels, no new UI surfaces (just data fields the UI can later consume). Existing v1.7.0 consumers see no behavior break except the documented S2 default-fill change below.

### Added

- **S1 — Choice container marker** (`ed8a352`): `ArxmlContainer` gains `isChoiceContainer?: boolean` + `choiceBranches?: readonly string[]`. `buildChoiceShell` populates both from the BSWMD-side `ContainerDef.choices`. Lets the UI distinguish choice shells from plain sub-container shells (previously byte-identical). 3 tests.
- **S2 — Sub-container default value fill** (`de8878e`): New `fillParamsFromBswmd(c)` helper extracted from the inline `buildTopContainer` loop; shared between `buildTopContainer` + `buildSubContainerShell`. Sub-container shells now start with BSWMD-declared defaults instead of hardcoded `params: {}`. Choice shells deliberately stay `params: {}` (branches are user-instanced). 5 tests added, 1 obsolete test removed.
- **S3 — Container description carry-through** (`e355c3e` + fix `7279170`): BSWMD parser gains `readDesc()` helper; `ContainerDef` + `ParamDef` gain `desc?: string`; `ArxmlContainer` gains `description?: string`. `buildTopContainer` + `buildSubContainerShell` + `buildChoiceShell` all carry `description: c.desc`. 8 tests (4 parser + 4 skeleton).

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL: `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` type errors** (`7279170`, code-reviewer finding): S3's `description: c.desc` and `desc: readDesc(item)` writesites initially failed TS2375 under the project's `strict-optional` setting. Fixed by adding explicit `| undefined` to the 3 new field declarations. Runtime contract unchanged; semantically the field is still optional.

### Changed (observable)

- **S2 default-fill observable behavior** (release-notes call-out): value-side ECUC XML written from a skeleton now contains `<ECUC-*-PARAM-VALUE>` wrappers at every depth instead of only the top layer. Anyone round-tripping a v1.7.0-built ECUC value file through a vendor tool will see additional default-valued parameter entries at depths that previously had empty `<CONTAINER-VALUE>` shapes. No downstream consumer breaks — all read `params[name]` and skip when undefined.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-21 — Cluster 3 I: dbc-forge reuse (plumbing only)

MINOR bump: **1 commit since v1.6.1**, 2010 → 2013 tests (+3 smoke). Brings `@dbc-forge/core` (Excel↔DBC↔Network TypeScript library, v0.1.0 PUBLISHED) into claude-AutosarCfg as a `file:` dep via sibling-repo fallback. Plumbing only — no production code uses dbc-forge yet. Real ARXML↔DBC bridging is v1.8.0+ scope per design §6.

> **Why sibling-repo `file:` instead of git submodule?** Network outage at ship time (`github.com:443` unreachable direct + via `127.0.0.1:7897` proxy) prevented `git submodule add https://github.com/jasontaotao/dbc-forge.git vendor/dbc-forge`. Local `pnpm install` worked via the existing `D:/claude_proj2/dbc-forge/` checkout. Future cleanup steps documented in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-v1-7-0-dbc-forge-integration-design.md` §3b.

### Added

- **`@dbc-forge/core` `file:` dep** (`6c4f5bc`): `package.json` + `pnpm-lock.yaml` resolve the library directly from `..\dbc-forge\packages\core` (36 transitive packages, 3.7s install). Sibling-repo fallback pending network-stable submodule migration per design §3b.
- **DBC bridge smoke test** (`6c4f5bc`): `src/__tests__/dbcForgeBridge.smoke.test.ts` (73 lines, 3 tests) — asserts expected public API surface (`parseDbc` / `writeDbc` / `deepEqualNetwork`), parses a minimal 1-frame DBC, round-trips `parseDbc → writeDbc → parseDbc` and asserts `deepEqualNetwork` true. Locks in the dependency contract so future production code can rely on it.
- **Design doc implementation delta** (`6c4f5bc`): §3a + §3b added to `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-21-v1-7-0-dbc-forge-integration-design.md` recording what shipped vs. what was recommended, plus future cleanup steps.

### Out of scope (deferred to separate PRs)

- Cluster 3 K — BSWMD-Free Stencil Wizard (depends on G validators now shipped in v1.6.0; planned for v1.7.1 or split into smaller sub-sprints).
- Real DBC↔ARXML bridging logic, Com/DbCom BSWMD generation from DBC — v1.8.0+ per design §6.
- Submodule migration (`vendor/dbc-forge/`) — blocked on network stability; per §3b.
- npm-publishing of dbc-forge — separate project (`D:/claude_proj2/dbc-forge/`); would let AutosarCfg switch to `^0.1.0` registry dep.

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-21 — Sprint 17 P3+P4 close-out + v1.6.0 deferred fixes

PATCH bump: **12 commits since v1.6.0**, 1976 → 2010 tests (+34), 0 type errors, 0 lint errors. Closes the Sprint 17 BSWMD remove-from-disk UI wiring (P3 + P4) plus 2 v1.6.0-deferred follow-ups (SWS Validator runner hook + A+C CLI `mutate` real applyMutation). Plus archive housekeeping (15 shipped plans/specs moved from `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/` to `archive/`). No breaking changes; safe drop-in upgrade from v1.6.0.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** Sprint 17 was originally planned as part of v1.6.0 but the P3+P4 sub-sprints didn't make the v1.6.0 cutoff (P1+P2 had shipped; P3+P4 followed up next session). The new user-facing feature is the BSWMD remove-from-disk context menu + × button 4-option dialog — a meaningful UX addition but not a new capability surface. v1.7.0 is reserved for Cluster 3 (dbc-forge integration + Stencil).

### Added

- **Sprint 17 P3 — UI wiring** (4 commits `7ae07b0` / `0e6202b` / `7915de9` / `b8433e6`): ProjectPanel `<li>` right-click + Tree `kind:'module'` forwarding + ContextMenu "Remove module" item + App.tsx router + LeftPanel `×` button rewire. Single source of truth: `useProjectActions.removeBswmdWithFullFlow(path)`. 8 new tests.
- **Sprint 17 P4 — Integration + E2E** (3 commits `224a8b4` / `8913e20` / `eb34230`): Full-flow integration test (`removeBswmd.fullFlow.test.tsx`, 6 tests covering all 4 dialog choices + partial-failure + undo) + 2 Playwright E2E specs (add+remove cascade + cascade-and-unlink disk verification). 6 new tests.
- **v1.6.0 deferred #1 — SWS Validator runner hook** (`24e13e9`): New `useSwsValidatorRunner(delayMs)` debounced hook in `src/renderer/hooks/`. Subscribes to `useArxmlStore` (doc + dirtyPaths + activeDocumentPath) and calls `useSwsValidatorStore.run()` after quiet period. Mounted once at App level. Gated on `experimental.swsValidator` feature flag. 4 new tests.
- **v1.6.0 deferred #2 — A+C CLI `mutate` real applyMutation** (`ac36f11` + review-fix `101335b`): New renderer-agnostic core engine `src/core/mutation/applyPatchSteps.ts` (533 lines). Handles RFC 6902 subset (`add` / `remove` / `replace`) + 3 AUTOSAR extensions (`set-param` / `add-child` / `remove-with-cascade`). `add` op delegates to `add-child` (corrects v1.6.0 silent no-op that over-reported `stepsApplied`). Atomic disk write via existing `writeAtomic` helper. 19 new tests (14 unit + 5 integration).

### Changed

- **Archive housekeeping** (`05875f9`): 15 shipped plan/spec files moved from `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/` to `docs/superpowers/archive/{plans,specs}/`. archive/ now 18 plans + 14 specs + 1 HTML preview covering v0.12.0 → v1.6.0. Per the archive's "Adding to this archive" policy (tagged + pushed + release-notes written). Saves ~30 KB context per dev session that would otherwise scan shipped artifacts as if they were TODO.

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL `add` op silent no-op** (`101335b`, code-reviewer finding): `applyPatchSteps` `case 'add':` previously returned `{doc, error: null}` without mutating the doc, causing the dispatcher to count `applied: 1` for a step that did nothing. CI patches using raw RFC 6902 `add` would report success without changing the doc. Now delegates to `applyAddChild` (extracts `shortName` / `SHORT-NAME` + optional `definitionRef` from `value`, returns `no-bswmd-for-module` when called without BSWMD context, `patch-invalid` for malformed value).
- **Lint import order in T4.3 Playwright spec** (`2f1199c`): `@playwright/test` import moved below `node:*` per project convention.

### Out of scope (deferred to separate PRs)

- `D:/claude_proj2/...` hardcoded fixture path in 5 integration tests — pre-existing v1.6.0 pattern; refactor to portable helper (e.g. `fileURLToPath(new URL('../../fixtures/...', import.meta.url))`) when CI moves to Linux.
- `cascade-required` error kind not in A+C spec §9.3 — subagent A's design choice; spec update pending.
- True RFC 6902 array-index `add` semantics (e.g. `path: '/foo/-'`) — current `add` only supports sub-container insert at named parent path. Spec promise vs implementation gap closed by `patch-invalid` for any other shape.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-21 — Sprint 14 Final cluster: Headless CLI + SWS Validator + Onboarding + Keyboard-First

MINOR bump: **4 new features ship behind feature flags default OFF** — Headless Config Engine CLI (`bin/autosarcfg.mjs`) for CI/CD integration, SWS Validator framework with 4 starter AUTOSAR rules (Com/PduR/EcuC/BSWMD), First-Run Onboarding tour (5 steps, bundled Demo ECU fixture with intentional violation), and Keyboard-First Power User mode (51 shortcuts + Cmd-K command palette + WCAG 2.2 AA a11y). 26 commits since v1.5.1, 1972 tests pass + 1 skipped, 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, project-wide coverage 96.61% / 87.72% (target ≥ 95.5% / ≥ 87%).

> **Why MINOR not MAJOR?** All 4 features are feature-flagged default OFF (`experimental.headlessCli` / `experimental.swsValidator` / `experimental.onboarding` / `experimental.keyboardFirst`). A user upgrading from v1.5.1 who never touches settings sees bit-for-bit identical behavior. The 4 IPC channels added (`headless:run-command:v1` / `headless:mutate-applied:v1` / `headless:validate-result:v1` / `feature-flags:get`) are additive — the 32 existing v1.5.1 channels are untouched. See `docs/superpowers/plans/release-notes-v1.6.0.md` for the full ship details.

### Added

- **Cluster A+C — Headless Config Engine CLI** (`bin/autosarcfg.mjs`, 4 commits `31e4903` / `2ef5d3b` / `beca4d6` / `0a9a428`): Standalone Node CLI using `commander.js`. 16 flags, 4 exit codes (0 success / 1 fatal / 2 partial-with-warnings / 3 invalid-input). `read` (dump ARXML to stdout) + `mutate` (apply JSON Patch RFC 6902 subset + 3 AUTOSAR extensions) + `--validate` (stub, emits `headless:validate-result:v1` event for SWS Validator integration). 3 new IPC channels in `src/shared/headless/ipc-contract.ts` with `:v1` versioning policy. 63 new tests.
- **Cluster G — SWS Validator framework** (`src/core/sws-validator/`, 7 commits `662b3bc` / `84d382a` / `87daaa8` / `79c8014` / `326b41c` / `22b391e` / `ed7761d`): ValidationEngine + RuleRegistry + 4 starter rules (`SWS_COM_PDUID_UNIQUE` / `SWS_PDUR_ROUTING_COMPLETE` / `SWS_ECUC_MULTIPLICITY_MIN` / `SWS_BSWMD_DEPS_PRESENT`). GUI ValidationPanel (bottom-docked). Sandbox copied from v1.3.0 Script Engine with 1-file parity test (H1 mitigation; v1.7.0 plan to extract `src/core/sandbox/vm-runner.ts` as canonical SoT). 52 new tests.
- **Cluster W — First-Run Onboarding** (`src/renderer/onboarding/`, 4 commits `fb1eaaf` / `ec5bc90` / `e995275` / `06b6178`): TourProvider with 5-state machine (idle / running / completed / dismissed / suppressed) + `validationPaused` field (in-process subscription to validator, no IPC). Bundled Demo ECU fixture (5 BSWMDs: Com/ComM/CanIf/EcuC/PduR + 5 value ARXMLs + `demo.autosarcfg.json` manifest with 1 intentional `SWS_COM_PDUID_UNIQUE` violation for tour Step 4 demo). 5-step tour overlay targeting `right-pane-content` (not G's ValidationPanel). 7-day suppress window. 80 new tests.
- **Cluster U — Keyboard-First Power User** (`src/renderer/keyboard/`, 5 commits `92c8279` / `847dc1d` / `57c64e3` / `cfe9875` / `037b924`): ShortcutRegistry + CommandPalette (Cmd-K) + CheatSheet (`?` key). 51 shortcuts (47 candidates + 4 G-coupled: F8 / Shift+F8 / Mod+Shift+V / Mod+Shift+E for validation panel integration). ResetOnboardingMenuItem wiring W's `tour:reset` IPC. WCAG 2.2 AA a11y: focus trap + `aria-keyshortcuts` + axe-core CI gate. 82 new tests.
- **Cross-spec integration test matrix** (9 scenarios, 22/22 tests pass, 8 integration files): A+C CLI read/mutate/validate/Demo-ECU-load + W Demo-ECU-via-CLI + G validation-result-to-CLI + U Cmd-K Run-Script + G tour-pause-validator + G sandbox-parity.
- **Feature flags infrastructure** (`config/featureFlags.ts` + `src/shared/ipc/featureFlags.ts` + `src/main/ipc/featureFlagsHandler.ts` + `autosarApi.getFeatureFlags()`): 4 flags default OFF, type-safe renderer access via `feature-flags:get` IPC.
- **Spec doc-rot fix** (`c4d6a40`): W spec §4.1 `writeAtomic` path corrected from `src/main/arxml/mutation.ts` to `src/main/ipc/projectSaveHandler.ts:50` (actual v1.5.1 PR(4) export site).
- **A+C wire-shape SoT** (`src/shared/headless/ipc-contract.ts`): `ValidatorResult` / `HeadlessCommand` / `HeadlessResult` / `HeadlessError` / `PatchDocument` types. `severity` narrowed to `'error' | 'warning'` (per implementation; spec updated to match).
- **i18n additions**: 124 new keys × 2 locales (en + zh-CN) — tour._ / headless._ / sws._ / shortcut._ / flag.\* namespaces.

### Fixed

- **10 type errors** (`680c5f7`): `combinedDoc.ts` (2 — `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`), `bswmdSlice.ts` (1 — `Window` not found; relocated `env.d.ts` to `src/shared/renderer-env.d.ts`), 7 web-tsconfig pre-existing errors (featureFlags test cast, `ModifierToken` literal, `MessageKey` narrowing, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`).
- **37 lint errors** (`680c5f7`): 34 auto-fixed via `pnpm lint --fix` (import/order); 3 hand-fixed (prefer-const, no-unused-vars, no-duplicates).
- **W-3 follow-up** (`1e3808e`): `data-tour-id="right-pane-content"` attribute added to `App.tsx` `<Panel id="workspace-right">` + 4 sibling attributes (closes C2.6 cross-cluster concern).
- **U-2 completion** (`1e3808e`): `feature-flags:get` IPC main handler shipped with 3 new unit tests (was deferred from U-2 PR).

### Deferred to v1.7.0 (not blocking v1.6.0 ship)

- **C2.3 — `useSwsValidatorStore.run()` has no caller**: Registry surface ships; `run()` body invocation is v1.7.0 follow-up (G spec §10 #4).
- **C2.4 — A+C mutate handler is a stub**: Real `applyMutation` (v1.5.1 PR(4)) wiring requires main-process CLI refactor (renderer `applyMutation` cannot be reused directly); v1.7.0 GUI bridge PR will deliver the wire-up.

### Test count

- v1.5.1: 1692 pass + 1 skip
- v1.6.0: **1972 pass + 1 skip** (+280 from 4 implementer agents)
- 22/22 cross-spec integration tests pass (8 files, 9 scenarios from A+C spec §10.6)
- Coverage: **96.61% stmt / 87.72% branch** (target ≥ 95.5% / ≥ 87%, per-cluster all meet or exceed)

### Known limitations

- **`bin/autosarcfg.mjs` uses Node's `--experimental-strip-types`** — works locally; published package needs esbuild bundling (post-v1.6.0).
- **G cluster sandbox is a copy of v1.3.0 Script Engine** with 1-file parity test as v1.6.0 mitigation; v1.7.0 plan is to extract `src/core/sandbox/vm-runner.ts` as canonical SoT.
- **U `useSwsValidatorStore.run()` is registered but not driven** — the 4 G-coupled shortcuts (F8 / Shift+F8 / Mod+Shift+V / Mod+Shift+E) wait for G cluster to wire the run bodies (v1.7.0 follow-up).
- **`arxml-stream` memory bounded-ness** remains unachieved (carried over from v1.5.1 PR(6) Sub-B) — `fast-xml-parser` 4.4.1 has no native SAX; v1.7.0 plan is to swap in a true SAX parser.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-06-21 — Foundation sprint + Sprint 17 follow-up

PATCH bump: **Foundation + 8 pre-Foundation commits** — pays down 4 tech-debt items, adds ARXML streaming + IndexedDB cache (feature-flagged default OFF per Q6 A), and ships the Sprint 17 P1+P2 BSWMD remove-from-disk flow + vendor-CDD module-root fallback. Closes the Sprint 14 #2 `applyMutation` follow-up. 12 commits since v1.5.0, 1692 tests pass + 1 skipped, 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, build success.

> **Why PATCH not MINOR?** The Foundation work itself has no user-visible features by default — `arxml-stream` and `preserveOrder` are feature-flagged OFF, and the `useArxmlStore` split is a pure refactor. The user-visible pieces (BSWMD remove dialog, vendor-CDD fallback) were already shipped to `main` between v1.5.0 and the Foundation start, and bundling them into 1.5.1 keeps the changelog and git history coherent (one tag, one release). If you'd rather split this into 1.5.1 (Foundation-only, MINOR-bump-quality) + 1.5.2 (Sprint 17 P1+P2 + vendor-CDD), revert the version bump and re-tag.

### Added (Foundation)

- **PR(1) — `isPathInside` hardening** (`3084370`): Extract the path-containment check from `src/main/ipc/register.ts:451` to `src/shared/paths/isPathInside.ts`. Hardens against path traversal (`..`), trailing slashes, Windows case-insensitivity, UNC paths, current-dir marker (`.`), double-slash normalization. 12 new unit tests. The deviation from the plan (using `node:path`'s `sep` instead of a hard-coded `/`) makes the implementation platform-correct on Windows.
- **PR(2) — `preserveOrder` source-aware serializer** (`d8f7dc5`): New `SerializeOptions.sourceArxml` parameter on the serializer. When provided, the output preserves source element order (the user hand-edits a file, re-saves, and the order doesn't shuffle). Index-alignment bug caught by `code-reviewer` HIGH (deletion case) and fixed via `Map<shortName, ArxmlPackage>` lookup. **Feature flag `experimental.preserveOrder` default OFF** per Q6 A — behavior is bit-for-bit identical to v1.5.0 when the flag is off.
- **PR(3) — `removeWithCascade` cascade-aware ref deletion** (`33cc250`): When a referenced container is removed, all inbound `REFERENCE-VALUES` are auto-dangled in a single BFS walk with cycle defense via a `visited` set keyed by full path. Returns `Result<{ removedPath, danglingRefs }, E>`. The `removeAtPath` behavior is unchanged; `removeWithCascade` is a strictly additive companion.
- **PR(4) — `applyMutation` real + atomic disk write** (`5b99ac3` + `9e762bb` + `fcd7aef`): Closes the Sprint 14 #2 follow-up. The Phase C stub at `src/renderer/store/useScriptStore.ts:288` is replaced with a real replayer that:
  1. Dispatches each `ScriptMutation` (`set-param` / `add-child` / `remove-child`) to the existing `useArxmlStore` actions (so the in-memory doc, dirty tracking, and validation pipeline stay in sync).
  2. Surfaces per-action failures (path-not-found, BSWMD missing, cascade dialog needed) in `runResult.errorMessage` instead of silent no-ops.
  3. Serializes the in-memory doc and persists via the `project:save` IPC channel (see T12-pre fix below).
  - **`writeAtomic` helper** at `src/main/ipc/projectSaveHandler.ts`: write-to-temp (`${file}.tmp-${pid}-${Date.now()}`) + `fh.sync()` + `fs.rename(tmp, file)`. Atomic on POSIX, near-atomic on Windows via `MoveFileEx` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING`. On any error, best-effort `unlink(tmp)` keeps the original file untouched.
  - **T12-pre fix** (`fcd7aef`): The original T6 cross-process dynamic import of `writeAtomic` leaked `node:fs` / `node:path` into the renderer bundle, breaking the production build with `"promises" is not exported by "__vite-browser-external"`. Routed through `window.autosarApi.projectSave` (the existing IPC channel that the main-side handler already implements with `writeAtomic` internally) — same trust-sprint invariant, correct IPC boundary.
  - **Loose-mode guard**: refuses to persist when no project manifest is loaded; surfaces a clear error and leaves the in-memory mutation applied so the user can save manually.
- **PR(5) — `useArxmlStore` split** (`94666ff`): Pure refactor, 0 new tests required per Q4 D. **3446 lines → 16 files** (7 slices + 7 helpers): `slices/{mutation,bswmd,import,ecuc,ui,project,i18n}Slice.ts` + `helpers/{combinedDoc,bswmdLookup,projectSync,paramUpdate,mutationErrors,importHelpers,dirty}.ts`. Largest file 492 lines. All existing 1638 tests preserved (the test count is the fuse).
- **PR(6) — `arxml-stream` package** (`d03c4e6` + `9dd112d` + `828bed1`):
  - **Sub-A scaffolding** (`d03c4e6`): new `src/main/arxml-stream/` sub-path with public `index.ts`, `feature-flag.ts` reader (settings.json + in-process override), and `router.ts` (`routeArxmlReader` dispatcher). 13 new tests.
  - **Sub-B SAX reader** (`9dd112d`): `emitSaxEvents` `AsyncIterable<SaxEvent>` + `streamParse` public API. 8 new tests (equivalence with DOM, error path, perf). **See known limitation below — memory bounded-ness is NOT achieved.**
  - **Sub-C IndexedDB cache** (`828bed1`): `deriveCacheKey` (filePath + mtime + contentHash) + `cacheGet` / `cacheSet` with automatic invalidation. 18 new tests (invalidation 10 + store 8). Default OFF via `experimental.indexedDb`.

### Added (Pre-Foundation, 8 commits rolled into v1.5.1)

- **Sprint 17 P1 — BSWMD remove from disk** (`fc2bf75`): `BSWMD_DELETE` IPC + `useArxmlStore.removeBswmdFromDisk` + `undoLastRemoveBswmd` (8-step rollback flow).
- **Sprint 17 P2 — `RemoveModuleConfirmDialog`** (`2128e43`): 4-option dialog (cancel / only / cascade / cascade-and-unlink) + `removeBswmdWithFullFlow` hook.
- **Sprint 17d — `EnumEditor` reads BSWMD layer + vendor CDD fallback** (`fe521bb`): Retires `ECUC_SUBSET_SCHEMA` (46-entry hard-coded fixture fallback). New `lookupSchemaAcrossModuleRoots` + `resolveTargetPath` folding `/AUTOSAR_R<NN>/` and `/EAS/`.
- **Sprint 17d follow-up — wire vendor-CDD module-root fallback end-to-end** (`d296a6f`): `EnumEditor` + `useArxmlStore` + `validate.ts#checkContainerMultiplicity` all use the new helper.
- **T9 spec/plan docs** (`82a3629` + `d8f5fc7`): The v1.5.1 Foundation design + implementation plan.
- **T0 — format cleanup** (`35b1bd0`): 127 files / +8798/-4820 via `pnpm format` + 2 HTML mockup bug fixes (`docs/bswmd-to-ecuc-mockup.html` had a duplicate `</body></html>` tail; `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-18-script-engine-design-preview.html` had an over-closed `</div>`). These were the only 2 hard failures blocking `pnpm format:check` since v1.4.0.

### Fixed

- **T12-pre fix** (`fcd7aef`): Renderer→main IPC boundary violation. See PR(4) above. Discovered while running the pre-ship `pnpm verify` for v1.5.1 — without this fix, the production build was broken and the tag could not ship.

### Known limitations (called out for downstream)

- **`arxml-stream` memory bounded-ness is NOT achieved** (PR(6) Sub-B). The `streaming` flag currently yields a post-parse event surface for renderer progressive rendering, not parse-time memory savings. `streamParse` is a thin wrapper around `parseArxml` + `fromArxmlDocument` because `fast-xml-parser` 4.4.1 has no native SAX mode, and the plan's "no new top-level deps" constraint ruled out `sax` / `node-expat` / `htmlparser2`. The `emitSaxEvents` `AsyncIterable` API is preserved for v1.6.0+ renderer work; the v1.7.0 plan is to swap in a true SAX parser. Documented in `src/main/arxml-stream/streaming/sax-reader.ts:1-11` and `streaming/index.ts:13-16`.
- **`deriveCacheKey` (filePath + mtime + contentHash) has no router consumer yet.** The router currently uses an inline-content hash for cache keys (`contentHashOf(content)` in `router.ts:175`). File-path invalidation machinery is built and tested but unused — wire-up deferred to the headless CLI in v1.6.0.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-20 — Wire BSWMD picker + context menu + segment-aware coverage

MINOR bump: **把 Picker / 右键菜单接上 UI** — 修了 v1.4.0 之后一直藏着的三个 P0/P1 缺口。1557 tests pass (从 1511, +46), 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, build success。

### Added

- **App.tsx mount BswmdPickerRoot + ContextMenuRoot + handleContextMenuAction** (`d0f3ecf`)：之前 `App.tsx` 完全没有 import 这两个 root 组件，store 里 `bswmdPicker` / context menu state 翻成 `open=true` 也没人渲染。修复后右击 tree 节点 → 弹菜单 → 点 Add parameter → 弹 picker → 选 → 写盘，端到端通。`handleContextMenuAction` exhaustively switch 5 种 `ContextMenuAction`（add-container / add-parameter / add-reference → `openBswmdPicker`；delete-container → `removeContainer`；delete-reference → `setInfo` toast，因为 store 还没 `removeReference` action，诚实地告诉用户这个 backlog 项）。
- **LeftPanel 接 onContextMenu prop + Tree/TreeNode 3-arg onContextMenu** (`d0f3ecf`)：Tree 节点右键捕获的 `MouseEvent` 完整传到 App.tsx，让 host 能用 `clientX/clientY` 弹菜单位置。

### Fixed

- **P0-1 — ProjectPanel chip 永远 0/0、+ 按钮永远 disabled** (`4ba5ec4`)：`ProjectPanel.tsx:265` 用 `bswmdPathsInStore.indexOf(bswmdPath)` 但 `manifest.bswmdPaths`（相对 forward-slash 如 `bswmd/JWQ3399.arxml`）跟 `state.bswmdPaths`（绝对 backslash 如 `C:\Users\...\bswmd\JWQ3399.arxml`）形态不一致，indexOf 永不命中。修复：`shared/path.ts` 新增 `bswmdKeyFor` helper（小写 + `\`→`/` + 取最后 2 段），`ProjectPanel` + `ModuleFromBswmdPicker` 用 `useMemo` 派生 `bswmdKeyToSchema: Map<key, BswmdDocument>`，O(1) 查询。
- **P0-2 — openProject 静默丢弃 IPC `bswmds` 字段** (`4ba5ec4`)：main 进程 `project:open` 返回 `{ manifest, docs, bswmds: [{rel, path, content}] }`，renderer `useArxmlStore.openProject({ manifestPath, manifest, docs })` 签名没 `bswmds` 字段，IPC 数据被 TypeScript 静默丢弃。修复：扩 `openProject` 签名为 optional `bswmds`，循环 `parseBswmd` push 到 `bswmdSchemas` / `bswmdPaths`（用 `entry.path` 绝对路径，跟 dialog 加的形态一致），`useProjectActions.openProjectFromDialog` 转发 `result.bswmds` 给 store action。**重新打开 project 后 schema 真的进 store**。
- **P1 — `isModuleCoveredByBswmd` segments[0] 错位** (`d0f3ecf`)：注释假设 `path = '/<module>/...'` 但 value-side 路径是 `/<AR-PACKAGE>/<MODULE>/<CONTAINER>/...`。当前 user 测试集碰巧 AR-PACKAGE 跟 module 同名 (`JWQ3399`)，但 vendor 工具普遍用 `JWQ_CDD_PACK` 这种 package 名 — 那个 case 下 add items 全 disabled。修复：inlined `stripCombinedPrefix` + `lastPathSegment` 跟 `useArxmlStore.ts` 那份 byte-for-byte 对齐，从 path 末尾往前 walk 找 module shortName；同时处理 combined mode 的 basename / `[doc:N]` 前缀。Backward-compat：原 caller 不传 `viewMode` 时仍走 single-mode + segment-walk。
- **MEDIUM-1 — ContextMenu z-index 撞车** (`d0f3ecf`)：ContextMenu.css 9995 跟 BswmdPickerDialog.css 9995 撞车，App.tsx 注释说 9998 跟实际不符。改 ContextMenu 9995→9994（sits below picker 9995 + cascade 9996 + confirm 9998），注释对齐现实。

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-20 — Project-load P0 patches

PATCH bump: **两个 P0 项目加载 bug** — chip 永远 0/0 + 重新打开 project 丢 BSWMD。1537 tests pass（基线），0 type errors，0 lint errors，build success。

### Fixed

- **P0-1 — ProjectPanel chip 永远 0/0、+ 按钮永远 disabled**：`ProjectPanel.tsx:265` 的 `indexOf` 跨 manifest / store 两种路径形态做严格字符串比较，命中概率为 0。`bswmdKeyFor` helper 双向 normalize 后做 O(1) Map 查询。
- **P0-2 — `openProject` 静默丢弃 IPC `bswmds`**：renderer 签名没 `bswmds` 字段，IPC 数据被 TypeScript 丢弃。扩 `openProject` 接收 + 循环 `parseBswmd` + 清旧 schema 防 cross-project leak。

详见 release-notes-v1.4.1.md（v1.4.1 + v1.4.2 合并叙述）。

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-20 — 4-bug fix batch (BSWMD MCC + skeleton tag + 3-segment path)

PATCH bump: **真实 vendor fixture 触发的 4 个 P0 bug** — 来自用户 `JWQ3399_bswmd.arxml` + `JWQ3399_EcucValues.arxml` pair。1537 tests pass（基线），0 type errors，0 lint errors，build success。

### Fixed

- **Bug 1 — BSWMD `<MULTIPLICITY-CONFIG-CLASSES>` 解析器静默丢弃**：`bswmd.ts` 之前完全没读这个块。`ContainerDef` / `BswModuleDef` interface 加 `multiplicityConfigClasses?: readonly MultiplicityConfigClass[]` 字段 + `readMultiplicityConfigClasses()` helper。Picker dialog 用 `moduleDef.multiplicityConfigClasses ?? []` 兜底。
- **Bug 2a — skeleton 用错 tagName**：`skeleton.ts` `buildTopContainer` + `buildSubContainerShell` 之前 emit `<ECUC-CONFIGURATION-CONTAINER>`（schema-side），但 `addContainer` + serializer 写 `<ECUC-CONTAINER-VALUE>`（value-side）— 跟后续 write path 不一致。改用 `ECUC-CONTAINER-VALUE`。
- **Bug 2b — skeleton 为 `lower=0` 容器预建空 shell**：`buildSubContainerShell` 之前不管 `lowerMultiplicity` 都 emit 一个空 container，留下 ghost placeholder。改为只在 `lowerMultiplicity > 0` 时 emit shell，返回 `ArxmlContainer[]`（而不是单个）让顶层用 `flatMap` 收口。AUTOSAR 惯例：skeleton 预建 minimum 1 instance，剩下的用户用 picker 加。
- **Bug 2c — `findByPath` 只接 4-segment path**：用户 UI 发的是 compressed 3-segment `/JWQ3399/JWQ3399ConfigSet/...`（当 `pkg.shortName === module.shortName` 时省 module 段）。Core 层之前假设 canonical 4-segment `/JWQ3399/JWQ3399/JWQ3399ConfigSet/...`。用户明确说"无法实现4段" — UI 改不了，core 必须接住。修复：`findByPath` 加 3-segment fallback（iterate `pkg.elements` 找 module 短名匹配 + 子容器 shortName 匹配 `rest[0]`），提取共享 `walkFrom` helper。`locateParent`（mutation.ts）+ `locateParentElement`（BswmdPickerDialog.tsx）现在都委托 `findByPath`。

### Code review findings (APPROVE_WITH_MEDIUM, 0 C / 0 H / 2 M / 2 L)

- **MEDIUM 1**: 3-segment fallback 在 multiple modules in same pkg 时静默 first-wins。**Dormant in current fixtures; AUTOSAR convention puts each module in own pkg.**
- **MEDIUM 2**: `replaceElement` / `removeElement` 用 `kind + shortName` identity match，not pkg-scoped。Compounds M1。**Dormant.**
- **LOW 1**: `multiplicityConfigClasses` optional type vs `buildEbModule` 永远 emit `[]` 的 cosmetic 不一致。
- **LOW 2**: pre-existing `appendChild` 永远 replace parent identity even when no actual change。Not from this fix.

详见 release-notes-v1.4.1.md。

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-20 — Trust Sprint (17a + 17b + 17c)

MINOR bump: **三个 trust-critical 修复** — round-trip 不再静默丢数据 / Dialog 全 i18n 化 / 写路径防 `..` 遍历。1511 tests pass (从 1493, +18), 0 type errors, 0 lint errors, build success。

### Fixed

- **P0-1 + P0-2 (Sprint 17c) — Round-trip 不再丢 vendor extensions**：`classifyElement` 对未识别 tag 返回 `ArxmlUnknown` 而不是 `null`；`renderElement` 通过 `{ [tagName]: parsed }` 原始 fast-xml-parser 节点 verbatim 发出。SERVICE-NEEDS / EXCLUSIVE-AREA / `/EAS/` namespace 等 vendor 扩展现在 round-trip 保留。新 fixture `vendor-extension.arxml` + 新测试覆盖。
- **P0-1 second-order drop (Sprint 17c) — 多 DEFINITION-REF 不再丢**：`renderModule` 修复了 `m.references[0]` 静默丢弃所有其他 `DEFINITION-REF` 的 bug。改为把所有 references 作为 top-level `<DEFINITION-REF>` siblings 发出（与 `parser.ts:500` 的 `asArray` 消费端契约匹配）。
- **H8 (Sprint 17b) — 写路径防 `..` parent-traversal**：新增 `path.normalize(p).includes('..')` 预检，覆盖 3 个写入口：PROJECT_SAVE（抽出为新 `projectSaveHandler.ts`） / saveArxmlHandler（per-doc write） / script-handler（manifest read/write）。关闭了 renderer 伪造 `../../etc/passwd` 的 CVE-shaped vector。

### Changed

- **H6 → P0 (Sprint 17a) — Dialog 全 i18n 化**：9 个硬编码 user-facing 字符串（zh-CN + en）替换为 `t(locale, key)`。7 个新 i18n keys (`prompt.*` 2, `app.import.diff.column.*` 3, `app.import.diff.referenceCount`, `confirm.unsaved.saveAndNew.import`)。`ImportEntry.tsx:64` 从 `window.confirm` 迁移到 app 自己的 3-state `confirm()`，与其他 dirty-guard 一致。`ConfirmRoot` 订阅 `useArxmlStore((s) => s.locale)`，切语言时 label 实时更新。

### Known limitations (deliberate, deferred to v1.5+)

- **Sibling order between known and unknown elements within a parent** is determined by model iteration order, not original source order. Full preservation requires `preserveOrder: true` (2-week refactor).
- **XML comments / CDATA / processing instructions** are still lost (parser config doesn't preserve them).
- **Full `isPathInside(manifestDir)` containment** is deferred because it would break the loose-mode back-compat contract at `register.ts:414-418` (users can open ARXMLs from anywhere and save back to the same path). The 17b fix closes the actual attack vector without changing UX.
- **Symlink bypass** — `path.normalize` doesn't resolve symlinks. A renderer that has write access to a symlink target can still write there. Tracked for v1.5+ as a follow-up.

### Out of scope (deferred with reason)

- **P0-3 file lock** — over-engineering for single-user desktop tool; EB tresos / Vector don't force locks either.
- **H1/H2/H4/H5/H7/H9/H10** — UX/architecture overhauls; defer to v1.5+.
- **M13 batch-write atomicity** — report was wrong; handler already uses `partial` discriminated union correctly.
- **All other MEDIUM and P1-P3** — defer to v1.5+.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-20 — Sprint 14 Script Engine

MINOR bump: **EB tresos 风格的 Script Engine** — 用户在 panel 内写
JavaScript，whitelisted ctx API 操作 ARXML project，validator / transformer /
report / free 4 种 kind 直接进入 ValidationPanel。21 commits, +184 tests
(1493 total).

### Added

- **Main core** (`14073ff` ~ `1aedd45`)：6 个新模块 —
  `types.ts` (ScriptEntry / ScriptLog / ScriptViolation / ScriptMutation 等
  5 个核心类型) / `errors.ts` (16 种 ScriptErrorKind 工厂 +
  `validateShortName` + RESERVED_SHORTNAMES 19 个保留字) /
  `import-resolver.ts` (DAG + cycle 检测 + depth-limit) / `ctx.ts`
  (whitelisted API surface — `project.findContainers` / `getContainer` /
  `validator.addViolation` / `log.*` / `utils.path`) / `transaction.ts`
  (WorkingCopy + commit/discard) / `vm-runner.ts` (`node:vm` 沙箱 + post-hoc
  timeout + user-line stack 捕获)。**零 react/electron import**。
- **5 个 IPC 通道** (`8227305` + `2ef9917` + `df47e23`)：
  `SCRIPT_LIST` / `SCRIPT_SAVE` / `SCRIPT_DELETE` / `SCRIPT_RUN` +
  `SCRIPT_PROGRESS` push channel。`script-handler.ts` (299 行) + preload
  bridge 5 wrappers。
- **25 个 i18n keys** (`55c55c8`)：zh-CN + en 双语，覆盖 panel / library /
  editor / output / violation / error 全部 scope。Parity 测试保证双语 key 集合
  完全一致。
- **3 个 sample fixtures** (`adbe248`)：`pduid-uniqueness.js` (validator) /
  `wdgif-defaults.js` (transformer) / `utils/path.js` (shared helper)。`node
--check` 全过。
- **Renderer** (`d0286bc` ~ `45e3d7c`)：
  - `useScriptStore` (Zustand singleton) + `useScriptActions` (IPC bridge)
  - `ScriptEditor` with **CodeMirror 6** (`@codemirror/state` +
    `lang-javascript` + `theme-one-dark` + `view`)
  - `ScriptLibrary` + `ScriptOutput` + `ScriptKindBadge`
  - `ScriptPanel` 3-column host (library / editor / output) + App/AppHeader
    Scripts toggle
  - `ValidationPanel` Script 校验 group（validator-kind 脚本的 latest run
    violations 单独列出）
- **T16 PduId validation E2E** (`569e710`)：
  `tests/e2e-vitest/script-pduid-validation.test.ts` — 5 个真实 fixture
  (Com_Com / Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf) 跑过完整 pipeline
  - 1 个 duplicate-injection case（`setParamInDocument` 强制 2 个 ComTxIPdu
    共享 id=42 → 验证 `script:pduid-duplicate` violation 触发）。
- **T17 Playwright E2E happy path** (`e071dfb`)：
  `tests/e2e/script-panel.spec.ts` — Scripts toggle → 选 fixture →
  editor 填充 → Run → output 渲染 logs + status='ok'。

### Changed

- **`vite.main.config.ts`** (`a9fad9d`)：`rollupOptions.external` 扩
  `node:vm` + `node:crypto`，Phase A import 的 Node-only 模块不再被 Vite
  错误内联到 main bundle。
- **`core/project/manifest.ts`** (`14073ff`)：additive
  `scripts?: ScriptEntry[]` + 兼容 normalization / migration path。

### Internal

- **Phase A lint polish** (`d947e53`)：post-pass cleanup — import order +
  `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` 兼容 + 删除 ctx.ts duplicated `walk`。
- **vitest include**：`tests/e2e-vitest/__tests__/**` 已纳入现有 include
  pattern（与 `tests/e2e/**` 互斥）。

### Verified

- 5/5 baseline gate green：format / lint 0 warnings / type-check / test
  (1493 passing / 1 skipped) / build (renderer 779KB / main 146KB /
  preload 2KB)
- T16 E2E：6/6 通过（5 fixture happy path + 1 duplicate injection）
- T17 E2E：spec file 通过 lint + type-check（Playwright 需 display server，
  CI 用 packaged Electron build 跑）
- Final self-review: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 14 LOW（全部记录为已知设计 gap
  或 Sprint 15+ follow-up）

### Out of Scope (deferred to Sprint 15+)

- 真实 ES module import（`_import` 当前是 stub）
- `ScriptPanel.handleNew` proper dialog（当前是 stub saveScript）
- `onCommitMutation` mutation replay pipeline 接通到 arxml store
- ValidationPanel Script 校验 group 点击跳转
- Code-split ScriptPanel 子树（lazy `import()` for CodeMirror 6）
- TypeScript-in-script 模式
- Multi-script run + 依赖图可视化

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-19 — Sprint 14 ECUC ARXML Import

MINOR bump: **EB tresos 风格 "Resolve Conflicts" wizard** — 多份 ECUC
ARXML 按 module 维度聚合导入，支持撞名 diff 表 + atomic commit + 单步撤销。
17 commits + 1 review-fix, +103 tests (1309 total).

### Added

- **`core/import/` 新模块** (`506aad0` + `31cb402` + `505fc8a` + `e266cb3`)：
  4 个纯 TS 模块 — `types.ts` (4/8/4 kinds unions + 18 类型) / `diff.ts`
  (`buildModuleDiff`) / `merge.ts` (`buildMergedView`) / `patch.ts`
  (`compileResolutionToPatches` + `applyPatchesToDocument`)。**零
  react/electron/zustand/fs 依赖**。
- **8 个 store actions** (`546b5ab` + `e9740f8` + `e3417a5` + `098ebbd`)：
  `startImport` / `selectModule` / `resolveModule` / `openDiff` / `closeDiff`
  / `commitImport` / `cancelImport` / `undoLastCommit`。
- **viewMode 三态扩展** (`546b5ab` + `8afe110`)：`'single' | 'combined'
| 'import-merged'`，互斥 guard 防止误切到 combined / 误触发 save。
- **`ImportSession` state slice** (`546b5ab`)：`importSession` /
  `lastCommitSnapshot` 字段；`isDirty()` 扩为
  `dirtyPaths.size > 0 || importSession !== null`。
- **`commitImport` 原子性** (`e3417a5`)：snapshot sourceFilesTouched →
  immutable apply → 任一失败 catch + rollback (importSession 保留) → 全部
  成功才 `set()`。`undoLastCommit` 用 snapshot 还原。
- **3 个 React UI 组件** (`31c7c78` + `e31ae68` + `d42821b`)：
  - `ImportEntry` (FileListTab `[Import…]` 入口 + multi-select dialog)
  - `ModuleSelectionPanel` (按 module 列出 + 撞名 badge + Commit 按钮)
  - `DiffTable` (三栏 existing/incoming/决策 radio + lazy diff + 嵌套展开
    - param 高亮)
- **18 个 i18n keys** (`7d49e5a`)：zh-CN + en 双语，从 `app.import.button`
  到 `app.import.undoLastCommit`。Parity 测试保证双语 key 集合完全一致。
- **8 kind `ImportError` union** (`506aad0`)：`read-failed` / `parse-failed`
  / `diff-failed` / `patch-apply-failed` / `multiplicity-exceeded` /
  `no-modules-selected` / `view-mode-locked` / `mixed-versions` + 类型守卫。
- **4 kind `ImportPatchOp` union** (`506aad0`)：`add-module` /
  `merge-into-module` / `overwrite-module` / `rename-incoming`。
- **Playwright E2E** (`41941f0`)：`tests/e2e/import-flow.spec.ts` —
  happy path (FileListTab → ImportEntry → ModuleSelection → DiffTable →
  commit → ConfirmDialog → 验证 dirtyPaths + viewMode 复位) + abort path
  (中途 cancel 不污染 store)。
- **verify stage 7 import regression** (`ae7d72b`)：
  `tests/regression/import-round-trip.test.ts` — 加载 2 fixtures → 模拟
  startImport → compile patches → apply → serialize → parse → 验证
  byte-identical。
- **internal undoStack** (`e9740f8`)：`ImportSession` 内嵌 ≤20 步
  `ImportSessionSnapshot[]`，仅 commit 前有效；cancel 清空。

### Changed

- **`useArxmlStore.ts`** (`546b5ab` ~ `8afe110`)：扩 3 state 字段 + 8
  actions；`computeDisplayDoc` 增加 `'import-merged'` 分支（复用
  `wrapPackageUnderSegment` 思路，segment 名 `[import:N]`）。
- **`App.tsx`** (`8afe110`)：viewMode 三态路由 — `import-merged` 时挂载
  ModuleSelectionPanel / DiffTable，隐藏 Save / Combined 入口；param editor
  仍可用但仅在内存态。
- **`FileListTab.tsx`** (`31c7c78`)：加 `[Import…]` 按钮（与 Combined
  入口互斥，dirty 时走现有 unsaved 保护）。
- **`scripts/verify.mjs`** (`ae7d72b`)：加 stage 7 import regression
  guard。

### Internal

- **Phase 1+2 cleanup** (`f9c5ce8`)：lint + type-check post-pass — drop
  unused imports / 替换 fixture / 重命名 unused arg。
- **Review MEDIUM-1 fix** (`0291817`)：删除 `patch.ts:143-152` 的 dead
  `'overwrite-module'` 分支（`ImportResolution` 不含此字面量，if-block
  永远 false）。

### Verified

- 5/5 baseline gate green：format / lint 0 warnings / type-check / test
  (1309 passing / 1 skipped) / build (renderer 391KB / main 126KB /
  preload 1.6KB)
- verify.mjs stage 7 import regression：byte-identical round-trip
- Final code review: 0 CRITICAL / 0 HIGH / 1 MEDIUM (fixed) / 2 LOW
  (deferred)
- 8/8 design invariants PASS: 0 new IPC channel / 0 modification of
  `core/arxml/*` / `shared/project.ts` / 0 forbidden imports in
  `core/import/` / exact 8/4 kind unions / `commitImport` atomicity /
  `isDirty` covers `importSession`
- 12/12 acceptance gates PASS（spec §11）

### Out of Scope (deferred to Sprint 15+)

- 删除 target 中 existing module（破坏性操作）
- 修改 / 重写 reference dest
- 跨项目导入
- 流式大文件 diff
- BSWMD 自动加载
- 删除 / rename target module
- 实时多人协作
- Review 2 LOWs：add-module silent no-op edge case / SelectionRow
  cosmetic locale read
- GH release 自动创建（gh CLI 未安装）

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-19 — Sprint 17 Polish Batch

10 follow-up polish items from Sprint 16 ship. Zero breaking change.

### Changed

- **T1 path** (`3c6d0b6`)：`toManifestRelative` 现在拒绝含 `..` 段的相对
  输入，防止 manifest 持久化时被注入 parent-traversal 路径。
- **T3 ui** (`6bfff66`)：Save All 按钮在任意 doc dirty 时加 amber
  `.is-dirty` 视觉提示（`--accent-amber` CSS 变量）。
- **T6 ui** (`c2b2628`)：ErrorBanner 支持 4 种 kind（error / warning /
  info / success），各带独立色 + auto-dismiss timer（error 不自动消失）。
- **T7 save** (`50adda4`)：`SaveArxmlError` 引入 typed kind discriminator，
  把 NodeJS errno code（EACCES / ENOSPC / ENOENT 等）映射到 6 种
  kind；renderer dispatch 本地化 toast。
- **T8 store** (`912cc7f`)：`resolveContainerTarget(state, containerPath)`
  helper 取代 7 处重复 `findByPathMultiDoc` inline block，零行为变化。
- **T9 picker** (`82ca016`)：BSWMD picker 在 doc set 变化时 re-resolve，
  修复 stale-seed bug（picker 开着时其他路径加载/移除文档）。
- **T10 tree** (`32c621b`)：`buildCombinedDocument` 对 identical root
  package（典型 EAS）静默去重；对 shortName 同但内容不同的 root 保留
  第一个 + emit `duplicate-root-conflict` warning。

### Added

- **T4 i18n** (`a314c35` 的一部分)：zh-CN 补 `app.saveAllPartial` 翻译。
- **T6 ui**：`setInfo` / `setSuccess` / `setWarning` / `dismissToast` store
  actions；3 个新 aria-label（warningAria / infoAria / successAria）。
- **T7 save**：`app.save.error.*` 6 个 kind 键（en-US + zh-CN 双语）。

### Internal

- **T2 audit**：确认 `ConfirmDialog` / `CascadeConfirmDialog` 的
  `'continue'` 分支是合法 cancel 路径（return `{ kind: 'canceled' }`），
  无 dead code，无需 commit。
- **T5 lint** (`bbcb693`)：清理 saveArxmlHandler 历史 ESLint warning +
  4 个 pre-existing TypeScript error。

### Tests

- **1206 tests passing**（v1.1.1 → v1.1.2 净增 +28，覆盖 10 个 polish task）
- Coverage: ≥ v1.1.1 baseline (90.72% branches / 96.8% stmts)
- 5/5 baseline: format / lint (0 warnings) / type-check / test / build
- 76 files changed, +7352 / -1895 lines

### Notes

- **首次 package.json 实际 bump**：v1.1.0 / v1.1.1 tag 创建时未同步 bump
  `package.json`（停留在 `1.0.0`）；v1.1.2 是首次让 `package.json` 与 tag
  对齐的 release。

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-19 — Sprint 16 Fixes Batch

Sprint 16 (16a + 16b + 16c) 集中修复 v1.1.0 ship 后发现 / 回归的 5 个关键
issue，重点在 DEFINITION-REF 链路 end-to-end 一致 + manifest 路径迁移 +
save/delete race。

### Added (Sprint 16)

- **Save All 按钮** (`5534cce`)：multi-ECUC dirty session 一键 save，每个
  文件独立的 partial-failure UI。
- **PICKER exclude + dirty-guard** (`a227220`)：picker 选择新文件时排除
  当前 dirty 文件；save failure 提示用户。
- **Sprint 16c #4 回归捕获** (`f7b69a3`)：controller 用 dedicated
  reload-then-save 测试抓到 parser 剥 `definitionRef` 的 silent regression。

### Changed (Sprint 16)

- **DEFINITION-REF 链路 end-to-end 一致**：parser (`f7b69a3`) /
  addParameter (`4453d46`) / addReference (`4453d46`) / serializer /
  skeleton 五层都 stamp `definitionRef`，reload 后再 save 不丢失。
- **v1.1.0 → v1.1.1 manifest 路径迁移透明** (`8fe1d28`)：`loadManifest(json, manifestDir?)`
  - `migrateManifestPaths` 接受老 v1.1.0 absolute-path manifest，不需要用户
    手动迁移。
- **Save-then-delete race 修复** (`dc92982`)：`removeEcucFiles` 在第一个
  save 失败时 `BREAK`，失败的 target 不再被 delete 掉（**数据丢失修复**）。
- **Combined Tree View smart basename wrapper skip** (`ad57e6a`)：避免
  重复嵌套同名 wrapper。
- **Silent save-back when currentPath known** (`8ac5243`)：save dialog
  在 currentPath 已知时静默回写，不再弹窗。
- **DEFINITION-REF 真路径写入** (`b767ea6`)：arxml 写出时把真实 BSWMD
  路径写到 `<DEFINITION-REF>` 而非占位符。
- **`<Module>_EcucValues.arxml` 命名规范** (`8858c9f`)：取代
  `<Module>_Cfg.arxml`，与 AUTOSAR 工具链约定一致。
- **manifest 路径持久化前 relativize** (`edaff98`)：确保 manifest 跨机器
  可移植。

### Tests (Sprint 16)

- **1178 tests** passing across 93 test files (1 skipped)
- **0 type errors** / **0 lint errors**
- **+149 tests** since v1.1.0 (1029 → 1178)
- 14 commits / 40 files / +3797 / -245

### Files (Sprint 16)

- `package.json` version: `1.1.0` → **`1.1.1`** (PATCH)
- New IPC contract additions (all additive, backward compatible):
  - `removeEcucFiles` accepts `phase: 'save' | 'delete'` discriminator
  - `loadManifest(json, manifestDir?)` adds optional `manifestDir`
  - `ParamValue` / `ReferenceValue` gain optional `definitionRef?` field

### Follow-ups (tracked for v1.1.2)

- `toManifestRelative` already-relative 透传不 reject `..`
- `saveArxmlHandler` collapse 所有 write error 成单一 kind
- T5 confirm dialog dead `'continue'` branch
- T5 picker stale-seed when documents change externally
- T7 CSS `.app-btn-save-all.is-dirty` visual cue
- T7 zh-CN coverage for `app.saveAllPartial`
- `info` / `notice` channel for success toasts (currently red ErrorBanner)
- Cross-task: consolidate "find doc by filePath" into single store selector
- `buildCombinedDocument` flat-mode duplicate root packages

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-18 — Sprint 14 BSWMD-to-ECUC

Sprint 14 落地 BSWMD schema-side → ECUC value-side 模块选择的完整 workflow。

### Changed (Sprint 14)

- **Q6 duplicate definition diagnostics** (`5b86510` on
  `feature/post-v1.0.0-wip`)：BSWMD 重复定义时给精准诊断信息。
- **Q1 resizable left/right columns** (`a8f78ee`)：workspace 列宽可拖拽。
- **Q2 two-segment grouping + dark-mode color fixes** (`45a225a`)：
  editor 双段分组。

  tab 拆分。

### Tests (Sprint 14)

- **1076 tests** passing across 89 test files
- **96.8% statements / 89.7% branches / 100% functions** (post-Sprint 14)
- **89 files changed**

### Files (Sprint 14)

- `package.json` version: `1.0.0` → **`1.1.0`** (MINOR — feature add)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-17 — Release Ready (Wave 4: coverage ≥90% + version bump)

The first **release-ready major** for claude-AutosarCfg. All Wave 1–3 work
(Left-panel, Phase 1 cleanup, Stage 4 i18n, validators, TemplateCard picker,
BSWMD chip multi-select, Combined Tree View) is shipped and verified. Branch
coverage has been pushed from 85.45% to **90.72%** (≥ 90% ship-gate met).

### Added (Wave 4)

- **Branch coverage ≥ 90% ship gate** (commit `TBD`):
  - Branches: 85.45% → **90.72%** (+5.27 pp)
  - Statements: 96.47% → 97.52% (+1.05 pp)
  - Functions: 100% (parity)
  - Tests: 678 → **876** (+198 cumulative since v0.13.0)
  - New test file: `src/shared/__tests__/path.test.ts` (7 tests)
  - Coverage closes: path.ts branches, serializer option flags, parser
    defensive structure checks, runtimeSchema choices/maxLength mapping,
    validate.ts walkReference layer-aware paths, manifest non-string path
    entries, bswmd AR-PACKAGES missing branch.

### Changed

- `package.json` version: `0.16.1` → **`1.0.0`** (MAJOR — release-ready)
- No behavioral changes from v0.16.1. This release pins the cumulative
  Sprint 12 / Sprint 13 / Wave 1-3 surface as the v1.0.0 contract.

### Tests

- **876 tests** (1 skipped; parity with v0.16.1 baseline + Wave 4 additions)
- **Coverage**: **97.52% stmts / 90.72% branches / 100% funcs / 97.52% lines**
- **5/5 baseline**: format + lint + type-check + test + build all green
- **Signed-guard**: 830 cross-ref baseline preserved [700, 850]

## [0.16.1] - 2026-06-17 — Wave 3 (Sprint 13 #2 Stage 3.4)

### Added

- **BSWMD chip multi-select in NewProjectDialog** (commit `c382a5d`)
  - Backend `templates:list` IPC now exposes `bswmdPaths: string[]` per builtin template (Stage 2 extension)
  - `src/renderer/components/BswmdChip.tsx` (47L) — single chip component (toggleable)
  - `src/renderer/components/BswmdChipRow.tsx` (76L) — multi-select row container
  - `src/renderer/components/BswmdChip.css` (78L) — Catppuccin Mocha styling
  - `BswmdChipRow` rendered below TemplateCardRow only on the **Classic** template path (Empty/Clone hidden)
  - Selected chips reset on dialog close + on template switch (covered by 2 explicit tests)
  - New i18n keys: `newProject.bswmdLabel` (选择 BSWMD 模块 / BSWMD Modules) + `newProject.bswmdHint` (多选/支持取消勾选) + `newProject.noBswmd` (Classic 模板下无可用 BSWMD)
  - 7 new BswmdChipRow tests + backend IPC test extensions

### Changed

- `NewProjectDialogProps.onSubmit` signature: `(name, dir)` → `(name, dir, opts?: { bswmdPaths?: readonly string[] })`
  - Backward-compatible: opts is optional; existing callers pass 2 args
  - `useProjectActions.submitNewProject` reads `opts.bswmdPaths` and threads through to `projectNew` IPC as `bswmdPaths?: string[]` field
  - IPC contract: `ProjectNewRequest.bswmdPaths?: string[]` added (also optional, backward-compatible)
- `TemplateCardRow` lifted from owned-fetch to controlled component (parent NewProjectDialog now passes `bswmdPaths` array; old IPC fetch path retained as a fallback for tests)

### Behavior

- Selecting BSWMD chips in NewProjectDialog → `manifest.bswmdPaths` populated on creation
- Stage 3.4 **does NOT copy BSWMD files into project dir** (only writes the manifest pointers); copy is deferred to a future stage (Agent G follow-up note)
- Production `samples/` currently has only `arxml/`; no `classic/bswmd/` shipped. The IPC stub returns `bswmdPaths: ['/samples/classic/bswmd/Can.arxml']` from test fixtures. Stage 2 plan Task 11 (extraResources) handles this when real samples land.

### Tests

- **809 → 830 tests (+21)**:
  - BswmdChipRow: 7 cases (empty / single / multi / select/deselect / reset on template switch / reset on dialog close)
  - Backend templates IPC: +1 case for `bswmdPaths` exposure
  - NewProjectDialog integration: +5 cases (chip behavior on each template path)
  - useProjectActions.submitNewProject: +8 cases (bswmdPaths threading)
- **Coverage**: 96.65% stmts / 86.55% branches / 100% funcs (parity with v0.16.0)
- **5/5 baseline**: verify all green; cross-ref 830 signed-guard [700, 850] PASS

### Code review

- **WARN**: code-reviewer agent invocation was interrupted during this stage (auto-mode classifier transient block). Agent G performed self-review:
  - IPC contract backward-compatible (new optional field on both ends)
  - State-reset semantics verified (close + template switch both reset selectedBswmdPaths)
  - `isTemplateAvailable('classic')` flipped to true (was false in Stage 3.3); existing tests updated
  - No CRITICAL or HIGH issues identified
  - **Deferred to follow-up stage**: BSWMD file copy into project dir on project:new (currently only manifest pointers are written)

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-17 — Wave 2 (Sprint 13 #2 Stage 3.3 + Stage 3.5)

### Added

- **TemplateCard picker UI** (Stage 3.3, commit `0c20e9c`)
  - `src/renderer/components/templates.ts` (52L) — template display helpers
  - `src/renderer/components/TemplateCard.tsx` (93L) + `TemplateCard.css` (91L) — single card component
  - `src/renderer/components/TemplateCardRow.tsx` (133L) — 3-card row container
  - NewProjectDialog body now embeds a TemplateCardRow (Empty / Classic / Clone)
  - Only Empty card is actionable; Classic/Clone render "coming soon" badge
  - 2 new i18n keys: `template.comingSoon` (zh-CN: 即将推出 / en: Coming Soon) + `newProject.templateLabel` (zh-CN: 选择模板 / en: Choose a template)
  - Card selection is visual only at this stage; submission still flows through `onSubmit(name, dir)`. Stage 3.4 will widen `onSubmit` to take `(name, dir, templateId)`
- **Combined Tree View** (Stage 3.5, commit `b16a2a9`) — user approved 2026-06-17
  - **Phase 1**: `buildCombinedDocument` + `findByPathMultiDoc` in `src/core/arxml/multiDoc.ts` (new)
  - **Phase 2**: `viewMode: 'single' | 'combined'` + `displayDoc` derived state in `useArxmlStore`
  - **Phase 3**: Tree component uses `displayDoc` instead of `doc`
  - **Phase 4**: FileListTab 顶部 `[Combined]` 虚拟条目 (4 new i18n keys: `fileList.combinedView`, `fileList.combinedViewAria`, `arxmlPanel.combinedDocs`, `arxmlPanel.combinedView`)
  - **Phase 5**: ParamEditor combined 模式路径解析 (uses `findByPathMultiDoc`)
  - **Phase 6**: 聚合统计 + dirty 标记 in combined mode
  - **Phase 7**: extend existing tests + add 6 new

### Changed

- NewProjectDialog body: now includes TemplateCardRow below the dir/browse row; visual restructure to fit cards gracefully
- useArxmlStore: added `viewMode` field + `setViewMode` action; added `displayDoc` selector (returns either `doc` or `combinedDoc` based on viewMode)
- FileListTab: top-level "Combined" virtual entry when viewMode = 'combined' shows aggregated count badge

### Behavior

- Combined mode is a view-only addition: no project save format change, no IPC contract change, no schema change
- Empty / Classic / Clone cards in NewProjectDialog: Empty flows through to existing `onSubmit` path unchanged; Classic/Clone disabled with "coming soon"

### Tests

- **746 → 809 tests (+63)**:
  - Stage 3.3: 13 templates + 13 TemplateCard + 8 TemplateCardRow + 5 integration + 2 i18n + 22 from helpers bundled = 63
  - Stage 3.5: 6 new + extended coverage on Tree/ParamEditor
- **Coverage**: 96.64% stmts / 86.55% branches / 100% funcs (vs v0.15.0 baseline 96.58% / 86.68% / 100%; +0.06% stmts, -0.13% branches, parity funcs)
- **5/5 baseline**: cross-ref 809 signed-guard [700, 850] PASS; ref-dest 0 / ref-cycle 0 / schema-unknown 0

### Code review (per-agent)

- Stage 3.3: APPROVE (0/0/1/2) — MEDIUM: 4 Stage 3.5 keys (fileList.combinedView, etc.) accidentally shipped in 3.3 commit (working tree pre-applied); Agent F's 3.5 commit immediately followed and references them — net clean
- Stage 3.5: pending (Agent F not yet returned at time of release; main loop will review on Agent F notification)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-06-17 — Wave 1 (Sprint 13 #2 + Stage 4 + 5.D)

### Added

- **Left-panel tab refactor** (Sprint 13 #2 Stage 3.1, commit `142c968`)
  - `App.tsx` mounts single `<LeftPanel />` instance; old stacked layout (ProjectPanelInfo / loose banner / Tree / ValidationPanel) removed
  - `LeftPanel` owns project / files / validate tab bar + always-visible Tree footer
  - Loose mode hides "project" tab automatically
  - 4 new App integration tests + 7 wiring tests
- **Stage 4 i18n polish M6/M7/M8** (commit `b924ccb`, with 8 keys shipped in `679ff25`)
  - **M6**: ParamEditor column headers localized — `editor.col.param` / `type` / `value` (zh-CN + en)
  - **M7**: OS pickDir dialog title localized — `dialog.pickDir.title` + `PickDirRequest.locale` IPC contract
  - **M8**: AppHeader `formatParseError` localized — `parserError.xmlMalformed` / `missingRoot` / `unsupportedVersion` / `invalidStructure`
  - i18n parity test 58 cases all green
- **Stage 5.D validators** (commit `ecb7385`)
  - **arxml:parse size cap**: 32 MiB on parse IPC, mirrors BSWMD_READ/BSWMD_PARSE pattern; extracted to `src/main/ipc/parseArxmlHandler.ts` (new)
  - **default-value cross enumerationLiterals**: warning (non-fatal) when `<DEFAULT-VALUE>` is not in the literal set; walks subContainers + choices recursively
  - **`<CHOICES>` recursion depth limit**: `MAX_CONTAINER_DEPTH = 64` fatal `invalid-structure`; XMLParser `maxNestedTags` bumped to 200 (two-layer defense)

### Changed

- **Phase 1 cleanup of Sprint 12 #3** (Stage 3.2, commit `679ff25`)
  - **`saveAndProceed` button real implementation**: `guardedDirtySwitch` accepts a `save` callback; `saveProject()` runs first, success proceeds, failure surfaces typed error
  - **`overwrite-confirm` IPC result → 2-button ConfirmDialog**: 覆盖/重命名 via i18n (`confirm.overwrite.{title,message,continueLabel,discardLabel}`); retry path uses `overwrite: true` flag
  - **`store.pendingAction` dead code removed**: `PendingAction` type + field + setter deleted; 5 hook call sites + 1 test import + 11 dialog tests removed
  - **per-action i18n for `confirm.unsaved.message`**: 12 new keys (4 actions × 3 messages: `message` / `discard` / `saveAndNew`); `SwitchingAction` + `toI18nAxis()` helper added

### Fixed

- `<CHOICES>` recursive parse: defense against pathological vendor file stack overflow (MAX_CONTAINER_DEPTH = 64)
- arxml:parse OOM risk: 32 MiB cap on parse IPC (was unbounded)

### Tests

- **703 → 746 tests (+43)**:
  - Stage 3.1: +11 (4 App + 7 wiring)
  - Stage 3.2: +18 (saveAndProceed + overwrite + per-action i18n)
  - Stage 4: +0 net (consumer code only; i18n keys shipped in 679ff25)
  - Stage 5.D: +14 (6 size cap + 4 default-value + 1 depth + 3 misc from parseArxml.test.ts)
- **Coverage**: 96.58% stmts / 86.68% branches / 100% funcs (within 0.2% of v0.14.0 baseline 96.78% / 87.01% / 100%)
- **5/5 baseline**: cross-ref 782 signed-guard [700, 850] preserved; ref-dest 0 / ref-cycle 0 / schema-unknown 0

### Code review (per-agent)

- Stage 3.1: APPROVE (0/0/1/1) — informational MEDIUM + LOW
- Stage 3.2: WARN (1/2/2) — HIGH scope creep (8 Stage 4 i18n keys physically in 679ff25; Agent C detected and shipped only consumer code in b924ccb; functionality split across two commits, accepted for Wave 1 coordination)
- Stage 5.D: APPROVE (0/0/0/3) — LOW cosmetic only
- Stage 4: APPROVE (0/0/0/0) — clean

## [0.14.0] - 2026-06-17 — Sprint 13 #1

### Added (backend only — no UI)

- **`src/main/templates/`** new module (7 files, 19 tests):
  - `discoverBuiltinTemplates(samplesRoot)` — opt-in scan of `<samplesRoot>/<id>/template.json` directories; warns + skips on parse / id-mismatch failures (one bad template never blocks discovery of the others)
  - `copyTemplateFilesToDir(template, samplesRoot, destDir)` — copy template files into a project directory, preserving `<templateId>/<relPath>` layout
  - `parseTemplateManifest(raw)` — hand-rolled type guard (no Zod, no new deps); validates `{ id: kebab-case, displayName, description }`
  - `walkArxml(root, opts)` — recursive `*.arxml` finder with `bswmd/` exclusion; skips hidden dirs
  - `classTemplateError(kind, message, details?)` — structured error envelope (7 kinds: 3 discovery + 4 IPC)
- **IPC channels**: `templates:list`, `templates:copy`
- **IPC types**: `TemplateListRequest/Response`, `TemplateCopyRequest/Response` in `src/shared/types.ts`
- **IPC handler**: `src/main/ipc/templatesHandler.ts` — `templatesListHandler` (returns summaries without leaking absolute paths), `templatesCopyHandler` (validates destDir + known template, then delegates to copy), `initBuiltinTemplatesCache()` (boot-time discovery, called from `app.whenReady` in `src/main/index.ts`), `resolveSamplesRoot()` (dev path: `app.getAppPath()/samples`; prod: `process.resourcesPath/samples`; returns null if neither exists)
- **Preload bridge**: `window.api.listTemplates()`, `window.api.copyTemplate(req)`
- **6 new i18n keys**: `template.empty/classic/clone.{displayName,description}` (zh-CN + en parity preserved)
- **`package.json` `build.extraResources`**: includes `samples/` in install bundles
- **`samples/arxml/.gitkeep`**: restored from stash as 5/5 baseline item
- **`samples/README.md`**: clarification note added — `bswmd/` (lowercase) is the convention for new templates; legacy `Bswmd/` (capital B) under `samples/arxml/<Module>/` is vendor sync data, silently ignored by the opt-in `template.json` gate

### Behavior

- Renderer (NewProjectDialog) is **unchanged** in this sprint. Sprint 13 #2 (Stage 3.3) will add the `TemplateCard` picker UI; the backend is ready and tested.
- The 100+ reference BSWMD under `samples/arxml/<Module>/Bswmd/` (capital B, legacy vendor sync) remain on disk and are silently ignored by `discoverBuiltinTemplates` (no `template.json` → opt-in skip).

### Tests

- **678 → 703 tests** (+25):
  - 5 `parseTemplateManifest` cases
  - 9 `discoverBuiltinTemplates` cases (using 6 fixture directories under `tests/fixtures/templates/samples-root/`)
  - 5 `copyTemplateFilesToDir` cases
  - 6 IPC handler cases (`templates:list` × 2, `templates:copy` × 4)
- **Coverage**: 96.78% stmts / 87.01% branches / 100% funcs (Sprint 12 #3 baseline 96.47% / 85.45% / 100% preserved; coverage **improved** by +0.31pp stmts / +1.56pp branches)
- **5/5 baseline guards**: all green; new item `samples/arxml/.gitkeep exists` added

## [0.13.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- NewProjectDialog 统一弹窗 (Sprint 12 #3):
  - 替换两步流程 (PromptDialog + OS saveDialog) 为单一自绘 dialog
  - Catppuccin Mocha 风格 (Variant A 视觉, 严格按 mockup)
  - 项目名 input + 实时验证 (空 / 非法字符 / >64 chars; validateProjectName 纯函数)
  - 目录 input + "浏览…" 按钮 (调 `project:pickDir` IPC) + 文件名实时 preview
  - Enter 创建 / Esc 取消 / 取消按钮
  - store-driven visibility (useArxmlStore.newProjectDialogOpen)
- ConfirmDialog 未保存保护组件 (Sprint 12 #3):
  - 3 按钮: 继续编辑 / 不保存新建 / 保存并新建
  - promise-based `confirm({ title, message, ... })` module-level API
  - Esc / backdrop click / × button = 'continue' (用户中断意图)
  - 复用 Phase 1 Task 5 dirty guard
- IPC channels (Sprint 12 #3):
  - `project:pickDir` (dialog.showOpenDialog openDirectory, defaultPath 可选)
  - `project:new` 扩展 (directory 字段, fs.access overwrite check, 'overwrite-confirm'/'write-failed'/'invalid-name' kinds)
- Store (Sprint 12 #3):
  - `isDirty(): boolean` function-on-state (永远不 drift out of sync)
  - `newProjectDialogOpen` / `confirmDialogOpen` / `pendingAction` discriminated union (4 kinds: newProject/openProject/addBswmd/removeBswmd) + setters
- useProjectActions 重写 (Sprint 12 #3):
  - `newProject()` 不再调 `prompt()` (PromptDialog 仍保留 for other use cases), 改为打开 NewProjectDialog
  - 新 `submitNewProject(name, dir)` 调 IPC + 处理所有 result kinds
  - `openProjectFromDialog` / `addBswmdFromDialog` / 新 `removeBswmdWithGuard` 加 dirty guard (ConfirmDialog)
  - **all switching actions** (newProject/openProject/addBswmd/removeBswmd) 触发 dirty 保护 (user 拍板)

### Changed

- `App.tsx` mount `<NewProjectDialog onSubmit={submitNewProject} />` + `<ConfirmRoot />` (z-index 9999/9998, 错开与 PromptHost 9997)
- `useProjectActions` 全面 dirty-protected (vs Sprint 12 #2 仅有 `addBswmd` 简化版)
- 重名检测 = 仅创建时 main handler `fs.access` check (race-free, 不再 client-side 实时检)

### i18n

- 17 new keys: `newProject.title` / `nameLabel` / `nameHint` / `dirLabel` / `dirHint` / `filenamePreview` / `browse` / `create` / `cancel` (9), `confirm.unsaved.title` / `message` / `continue` / `discard` / `saveAndNew` (5), `app.error.projectNameEmpty` / `projectNameInvalid` / `projectNameTooLong` (3)
- `confirm.unsaved.message` 用 `{name}` placeholder, 通用文案适用于 all switching actions (newProject/openProject/addBswmd/removeBswmd)

### Phase 1 Simplifications (deferred to Sprint 13)

- 'saveAndProceed' button in ConfirmDialog 暂不实现 (Phase 1 与 'continue' 都返回 canceled, 提示用户先手动保存)
- 'overwrite-confirm' IPC result Phase 1 简化为显示 error (不弹二次 confirm dialog)
- Phase 2 模板 (empty/classic/clone) 推迟到 Sprint 13 #1
- Phase 3 BSWMD 模块多选 chips 推迟到 Sprint 13 #2

### Tests

- 121 new tests (515 Sprint 12 #2 baseline + 121 = 636)
- Coverage: 96.42% lines / 85.45% branches (守住 80% floor)
- 5/5 baseline fixtures 0 violation (schemaLayer 行为不变)
- code-reviewer: APPROVE (0 critical / 0 high) (per Part A agent report)

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-16 (Sprint 12 #2 - BSWMD renderer 集成)

### Added

- BSWMD schema-side 集成 (Sprint 12 #1 + #2 累计):
  - `parseBswmd` + `BswmdDocument` types (Sprint 12 #1)
  - `SchemaLayer` + `buildSchemaLayer(documents)` runtime schema layer
  - validator 集成: `validate(doc, layer?)` / `validateProject(documents, layer?)` 接受可选 `SchemaLayer`
  - **NEW** validation kind `'schema-unknown'`: emitted when a `SchemaLayer` is provided and a query path is in neither the layer nor the static `ECUC_SUBSET_SCHEMA` (gates on BSWMD-declared module)
  - store: `bswmdSchemas: BswmdDocument[]` + `bswmdPaths: string[]` state; `addBswmd(path, content)` 真实实现 (含 dedupe by path 拒绝); `removeBswmd(path)` 新 action
  - IPC: `bswmd:read` (file read, 8 MiB cap) + `bswmd:open` (file dialog)
  - ProjectPanel: BSWMD FileList "Load BSWMD..." 按钮 + list item remove 按钮 (OpenView only; LooseView 不渲染 BSWMD section)
  - useProjectActions: `addBswmdFromDialog()` 新 action, loose mode 直接拒绝
  - 端到端 smoke: 真实 BSWMD fixture (`Adc_bswmd.arxml` 81KB) 跑 enum 合法/非法 + schema-unknown 三个 case

### Changed

- `lookupSchema(paramPath)` / `lookupContainerSchema(containerPath)` 接受可选 `SchemaLayer` (向后兼容; `layer=undefined` 行为不变)
- App version string `0.11.0` → `0.12.0` (minor bump: feature release).

### i18n

- 6 new keys: `projectPanel.bswmd.add`, `projectPanel.bswmd.addAria`, `app.error.readBswmdFailed`, `app.error.parseBswmdFailed`, `app.error.duplicateBswmd`, `app.error.needProject`
- `projectPanel.bswmd.empty` 文案更新 (反映 Sprint 12 #2 "Load BSWMD" 按钮)

### Tests

- 87 new tests (428 Sprint 12 #1 baseline + 87 = 515)

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-16 (Sprint 12 #1 — BSWMD parser)

### Added

- **BSWMD parser** (`src/core/project/bswmd.ts`) — pure-TS, zero-dep schema-side parser. Recognises 2 dialects:
  - **EB tresos** `<BSW-MODULE-DESCRIPTION>` — SHORT-NAME + MODULE-ID + PROVIDED-ENTRYS (both wrapper-shape with `<SHORT-NAME>` + `<ENTRY-REF>`, and the real-data fallback where `<BSW-MODULE-ENTRY-REF>` sits inside the wrapper without a `<SHORT-NAME>` sibling — entry short-name is derived from the last path segment and a warning is recorded).
  - **AUTOSAR standard** `<ECUC-MODULE-DEF>` — full tree: CONTAINERS (ECUC-PARAM-CONF-CONTAINER-DEF + ECUC-CHOICE-ORIENTED-STRUCTURE-DEF) / SUB-CONTAINERS / PARAMETERS (integer / boolean / enumeration / float / string / **function-name**) / REFERENCES (ECUC-REFERENCE-DEF + ECUC-FOREIGN-REFERENCE-DEF) / MULTIPLICITY (number / 'infinite').
- 4 lookup helpers for Sprint 13 validation integration: `findModuleByPath` / `lookupContainerDef` / `lookupParamDef` / `lookupReferenceDef`.
- `BswmdError` discriminated union (4 kinds) mapped 1:1 to i18n keys.
- `ProvidedEntry.entryKind` field (`@_DEST` attribute value, typically `BSW-MODULE-ENTRY`) — lets the Sprint 13 editor distinguish entry kinds when rendering.
- IPC `bswmd:parse` channel — parse-only, file I/O stays in `project:open`. Renderer-side integration (`useArxmlStore.bswmdSchemas`) deferred to Sprint 13. **Size cap** of 8 MiB on incoming `content` (returns `xml-malformed` for larger payloads — prevents a tampered preload bridge from OOMing the main process).
- BSWMD fixtures: `tests/fixtures/bswmd/Can_Bswmd.arxml` (14KB EB tresos) + `Adc_bswmd.arxml` (80KB AUTOSAR standard), byte-identical copies of real user data. Round-trip test asserts dialect, moduleId, container / param structure, recursive totals (7 containers / 42 parameters / 8 references for Adc), and real-data `providedEntries` recovery.
- 4 new i18n keys (`bswmdParser.xmlMalformed` / `missingRoot` / `unsupportedVersion` / `invalidStructure`) for human-readable error messages; `projectPanel.bswmd.empty` updated to drop the "Phase 2 will add a button" stub.
- Numeric-format AUTOSAR namespaces accepted in `SUPPORTED_VERSIONS` (e.g. `00046` ≡ R4.6); regex already supported the shape, the supported set just didn't list it.

### Changed

- App version string `0.10.0` → `0.11.0` (minor bump: feature release).
- `vitest.config.ts` `include` glob now picks up `tests/**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` so the new fixture-driven round-trip tests are discovered.
- `vitest setup` (`src/test/setup.ts`) now fails fast with a clear message if `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID` is unavailable — protects manifest tests against future vitest/jsdom bumps that might drop the Web Crypto polyfill.
- Lint drift (16 files prettier-formatted + 5 `import()`-type annotations split into top-level `import type` declarations) accumulated since Sprint 11 was committed — restored to parity.

### Fixed

- `TreeNodeProps.subtitle` changed from required to optional. Sprint 9 #4.x switched element rows from a text subtitle to a colored `kind` dot, but the type still declared `subtitle: string` — type-check failed → renderer build failed → entire AppHeader didn't render → "新建项目 / 打开项目 / 打开" 3 button 看似无反应.
- `core/project/manifest.ts` UUID generator switched from `node:crypto` import to `globalThis.crypto.randomUUID()`. The previous import pulled `__vite-browser-external` into the renderer bundle, which has no `randomUUID` export → renderer build failed.
- **HIGH (code-reviewer):** EB tresos `providedEntries` recovery — the original parser silently dropped entries where `<BSW-MODULE-ENTRY-REF-CONDITIONAL>` lacked a `<SHORT-NAME>` sibling (the real-world EB tresos shape). Now derives `shortName` from the inner `<BSW-MODULE-ENTRY-REF>`'s path text, captures `@_DEST` as `entryKind`, and pushes a fallback warning per entry.
- **MEDIUM (code-reviewer):** `<ECUC-FUNCTION-NAME-DEF>` previously collapsed to `kind: 'string'`. Distinct `'function-name'` ParamKind added so the Sprint 13 editor can render a symbol picker instead of a free-text input.

### Test coverage

- 374 → 426 tests passing (+52): 22 bswmd parser core (incl. function-name + numeric-namespace + EB-tresos-fallback cases), 17 fixture round-trip (incl. recursive totals assertion), 5 IPC handler shape, 8 i18n.
- All 5 baseline fixtures still produce the same `validateProject` totals: 782 cross-ref / 0 ref-dest / 0 ref-cycle. No regressions.
- Stmts / branches coverage stay ≥96% / ≥85% — only additive code in the new dialect walker.

### Code review

- 0 critical / 0 high / 2 medium / 3 low remaining after pre-tag fixes. The 2 medium (default-value cross-validation against `enumerationLiterals`, recursion depth limit on deeply-nested `<CHOICES>`) and 3 low are deferred to Sprint 13+ with explicit notes. Verdict: **APPROVE**.

### Known gaps (deferred to Sprint 13+)

- Renderer integration — `useArxmlStore.bswmdSchemas` not yet populated. `project:open` already returns BSWMD content; Sprint 13 wires the store to call `bswmd:parse` on each entry and expose the resulting `BswmdDocument[]` to `validateProjectForRenderer`.
- BSWMD serializer — read-only this sprint. Add when UI round-trip is needed.
- Equivalent size cap on `arxml:parse` IPC channel (reviewer MEDIUM, deferred to keep this sprint's diff focused on BSWMD).
- Default-value cross-validation against `enumerationLiterals` (push a warning if `<DEFAULT-VALUE>` is not in the literal set) — schema-side hardening for Sprint 13.
- Recursion depth limit on `<CHOICES>` chains — current implementation trusts input depth; a pathological vendor file could stack-overflow. Tracked.
- AppHeader Ribbon UI refactor (Sprint 12 #0) deferred — current single-row toolbar still ships in v0.11.0.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-16 (Sprint 11 — Project Manifest + i18n)

### Added

- **Project Manifest** (`<name>.autosarcfg.json`) — distinguishes a user's project from a generic doc collection. Co-located with the value-side ARXMLs. Stores `id` (UUID) + `name` + `valueArxmlPaths` + `bswmdPaths`. Schema-versioned (`schemaVersion: "1"`).
- `src/core/project/manifest.ts` — pure helpers `loadManifest(json)` / `saveManifest(m)` / `validateManifest(m)` / `createEmptyManifest(name)`. Path-shape checks refuse `..` / absolute / empty paths so a hostile manifest can't escape its directory at the main-process read step.
- **i18n framework** — `src/shared/i18n.ts` exports `Messages` interface + `MessagesZhCN` + `MessagesEn` + `t(locale, key, params?)` helper. Parity test enforces both bundles cover the same key set. Default locale: `zh-CN` (per user request).
- `src/renderer/components/ProjectPanel.tsx` + `.css` — sidebar that surfaces the project's value-side ARXMLs + BSWMDs, or shows a "no project loaded" hint with quick New/Open buttons in loose mode.
- `src/renderer/hooks/useProjectActions.ts` — shared hook returning `newProject()` / `openProjectFromDialog()` / `saveProject()`. Both `AppHeader` and `ProjectPanel` consume it; no synthetic-click coupling.
- IPC: `PROJECT_NEW` / `PROJECT_OPEN` / `PROJECT_SAVE` channels. `PROJECT_OPEN` returns `{ rel, path, content }` triples (matching by manifest-relative path so two docs sharing a basename pair correctly). Path-containment check via `path.relative` refuses escapes from the manifest directory.

### Changed

- `AppHeader` adds three project buttons (New / Open Project / Save Project) + a project chip when a project is open + a `中/EN` locale toggle. Every user-facing string routes through `t()`.
- `ValidationPanel` / `ArxmlPanel` / `Tree` / `ParamEditor` translated. ParamEditor keeps the technical type names (`integer` / `float` / etc.) untranslated — they map to ECUC standard identifiers engineers read in English.
- `useArxmlStore` gains `project` / `projectPath` / `locale` state + `openProject` / `closeProject` / `addBswmd` (Phase-1 stub) / `setLocale` actions. `addDocument` / `removeDocument` sync `project.valueArxmlPaths` when a project is open; loose mode (project null) is unchanged — 329 prior tests still pass.
- `closeProject()` preserves `documents[]` and `dirtyPaths` so the user keeps editing in loose mode without losing unsaved changes.
- `useDebouncedValidation` and the renderer data flow are unchanged; validation still runs on every mutation via the existing inline calls.
- App version string `0.9.5` → `0.10.0` (minor bump: feature release).

### Fixed

- **HIGH: basename collision** in `openProject` — the renderer now matches by `rel` (manifest-relative path) instead of `path.endsWith(rel)`. Two ARXMLs sharing a basename in different sub-directories of the same project pair to the correct manifest slot.
- **HIGH: synthetic-click coupling** — `ProjectPanel.LooseView` used to fire `document.querySelector(...).click()` on `AppHeader`'s buttons. Replaced with shared `useProjectActions` hook; `ProjectActionResult` discriminated union drives error feedback in either component.
- **HIGH: silent data-loss risk** — Save Project only persists the manifest. Disabled when `dirtyPaths.size > 0`; tooltip routes the user to the per-doc Save flow via the new `app.project.saveBlockedDirty` i18n key.
- `ArxmlPanel` no longer carries a local `FOOTER_KEYS` ad-hoc dictionary — replaced with `t('arxmlPanel.packages' | 'elements' | 'unsaved')` so the parity test enforces coverage.

### Test coverage

- 329 → 374 tests passing (+45): 19 manifest, 14 store project (including the new basename-collision test), 11 i18n.
- All 5 baseline fixtures still produce the same `validateProject` totals: 782 cross-ref / 0 ref-dest / 0 ref-cycle. No regressions.
- Stmts / branches coverage stay ≥96% / ≥85% — only additive code, no existing paths modified in a behavior-changing way.

### Known gaps (deferred to Sprint 12+)

- `formatParseError` strings in `AppHeader` stay English (parser error localisation needs main+renderer coordination).
- OS dialog titles (Open ARXML / New Project / Save ARXML) are hardcoded English — would need a `locale` parameter in the IPC handler.
- `ParamEditor` column headers (Param / Type / Value) and the `aria-label="Parameter editor"` stay English.
- BSWMD parser (`src/core/bswmd/parser.ts`) is an empty placeholder — Sprint 11 Phase 2 wires it up next.
- `addBswmd` store action is a Phase-1 no-op; the IPC `PROJECT_OPEN` already returns BSWMD content but the renderer ignores it until Phase 2 lands.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-06-16 (Sprint 9 #4 — shortName uniqueness fallback)

### Added

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `tryResolveByShortName(path, pathIndex): PathIndexEntry | undefined` that resolves a cross-ref target's leaf shortName against the project's path index. Returns the unique `PathIndexEntry` matching the leaf if there is exactly one; returns `undefined` if the leaf is missing or ambiguous. Closes branch-mismatch cases where the fixture VALUE-REF says e.g. `/EcucDefs/Com/ComConfig/ComIPduGroup/CAN_NetworkTx` but the element actually lives at `/EcucDefs/Com/CanConfigSet/CAN_NetworkTx` (sibling branch match). Pure / side-effect-free / immutable.
- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `tryResolveByShortNameWithIndex(path, shortNameIndex): PathIndexEntry | undefined`, the lower-level overload that accepts a pre-built shortName reverse-index. Used by `checkCrossRefs` to amortise the O(n) index-build cost across all sites.
- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `buildShortNameIndex(pathIndex): ReadonlyMap<string, readonly PathIndexEntry[]>` that builds a `shortName → entries[]` reverse index. O(n) build, O(1) lookup.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/tryResolveByShortName.test.ts` — 15 unit tests covering: main case, 0-match, 2-match ambiguous, 3-match ambiguous, empty path, 1-segment path, trailing-slash, case-sensitivity, sibling-branch, empty pathIndex, numeric-leaf, mixed-kind duplicates, 1000-entry perf sanity, cross-module resolve, consecutive-slashes.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/checkCrossRefs.test.ts` — 7 E2E tests verifying the fallback integration: exact match still works, branch-mismatch target resolves, ambiguous leaf still emits cross-ref, missing leaf still emits cross-ref, paramKey / sourcePath preserved on emitted error, placeholder filtering runs before fallback, mixed classification in a single call.

### Changed

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — `checkCrossRefs` builds a shortName reverse-index once at function entry (`O(n)`), then after the strict `pathIndex.has(resolveTargetPath(...))` lookup, runs the leaf-uniqueness fallback via `tryResolveByShortNameWithIndex`. If the fallback hits, the site is treated as resolved and no error is emitted. Misses (0 match or ≥2 ambiguous) fall through to the existing cross-ref error path unchanged.
- `src/core/validation/index.ts` — barrel re-exports `buildShortNameIndex`, `tryResolveByShortName`, and `tryResolveByShortNameWithIndex` alongside the existing `normalizePath` / `tryStripTypeSegment` / `resolveTargetPath` family.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — baseline console.log now prints `cross-ref (unique-resolved by shortName): N` line; signature guard band tightened from `[800, 1100]` to `[700, 850]` for both `crossRefErrors.length` and `allErrors.length` to reflect the 221-site reduction; header comment block updated to document the Sprint 7 → Sprint 8 #1 → Sprint 9 #1 → Sprint 9 #2 → Sprint 9 #3 → Sprint 9 #4 baseline evolution.
- `package.json` — version `0.9.4 → 0.9.5` (PATCH bump; pure helper addition).
- `src/main/ipc/register.ts` — `GET_APP_VERSION` `'0.9.4' → '0.9.5'` sync.

### Verified

- `pnpm vitest run` — **267 tests pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped** (Sprint 9 #3 245 → Sprint 9 #4 267, +22 new). All 27 test files green.
- `pnpm vitest run --coverage` — **96.03% stmts / 84.03% branches / 100% funcs** (Sprint 9 #3 95.84% / 83.37% / 100%; +0.19% stmts, +0.66% branches from the new dedup / unique-only branches).
- 5-fixture project-level baseline numbers (Sprint 9 #4): `pathIndex.size` 1611, `refSites.length` 1336, `referenceParams.total` 1341, `cross-ref errors` **782** (was 1003, −221 unique-resolved), `ref-dest errors` 0, `ref-cycle errors` 0, `validateProject total` **782**.
- 5/5 per-doc baseline: 0 per-doc violation preserved.
- Public API: `checkCrossRefs` / `validateProject` / `buildPathIndex` / `extractReferences` signatures unchanged (the new helper is internal; only the public barrel re-exports the standalone helpers). Existing 5-fixture round-trip deep-equal signature preserved. Existing `'cross-ref'` kind behaviour unchanged — silent resolve is the new behaviour, but the error kind is the same as before when a site does not resolve.

### Deviations

- **silent resolve vs new `kind-cross-ref-fuzzy`**: the 1003 dangles closed by the fallback are silently resolved rather than emitted as a new `kind`. Introducing a 10th `ValidationErrorKind` would require a `types.ts` union extension, a `types.test.ts` 9→10 update, a new `ValidationPanel.css` colour (current 9 colours already approach the upper limit of distinct hues), and a fixtures-test `e.kind === 'cross-ref'` guard rewrite. The silent-resolve trade-off loses the "this was a fuzzy resolve, not an exact match" audit signal, but keeps the scope at 30-50 new lines instead of 4-file cross-cutting changes. Documented in PROGRESS §Deviations #1 with an explicit extension point: if ambiguous-case false-negative risk surfaces in user data, add `kind-cross-ref-fuzzy` then.
- **782 ambiguous dangles remain as genuine cross-ref errors**: the 1003 dangles were partitioned as 221 unique (1 match in pathIndex), 782 ambiguous (≥2 matches), 0 not-found. The 221 unique cases close cleanly; the 782 ambiguous cases share a leaf shortName with at least one other element and cannot be safely auto-resolved without a richer heuristic (suffix matching, parent-N lookup, etc). These remain reported as `kind: 'cross-ref'` errors and constitute fixture data quality issues (branch-mismatch cross-references in real BSW configuration data), not validator gaps. Documented in PROGRESS §Deviations #2.
- **No `'cross-ref-fuzzy'` UI test additions**: same convention as Sprint 9 #2 and #3 — `ValidationPanel.tsx` is data-driven via `groupByKind` + `Object.entries(grouped).map(...)`, so no kind auto-rendering change was needed. The two `ValidationPanel` integration tests verify the panel renders without crashing; they do not assert a specific kind set, so no test was added for the silent-resolve change. The `kind: 'cross-ref'` CSS class is purely visual and matches the existing convention of untested visual styling.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 9 #2 — target-side ref dest validation)

### Added

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `checkRefDests(refSites, pathIndex): readonly ValidationError[]` that performs target-side reference DEST-kind validation. After a cross-ref resolves in `pathIndex`, the resolved entry's `kind` must match the consumer's declared `site.targetDest`. Complements the existing schema-side `'reference'` kind check (which compares source's DEST against the schema entry's `refDest`) with a target-existence complement (compares source's DEST against the resolved target's actual kind).
- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new file-level constant `DEST_KIND_MAP: ReadonlyMap<string, ReadonlySet<PathIndexEntry['kind']>>` mapping the three standard ECUC target-kind DEST values to the set of allowed pathIndex entry kinds. Unrecognised DEST values (e.g. `ECUC-INTEGER-PARAM-DEF`, `ECUC-FUNCTION-NAME-DEF`) are skipped silently — their natural target is a param value not a path-indexed container/module/reference, so there is no ground truth to compare against. Maintenance contract: when a vendor DEST value proves stable (e.g. `ECUC-CHOICE-REFERENCE-DEF` after Sprint 9 #14 CanIf), add the mapping here with one line + a unit test pinning the new rule.
- `src/core/validation/types.ts` — `ValidationErrorKind` union gains `'ref-dest'` (now 8 kinds: `range` / `enum` / `reference` / `required` / `schema` / `multiplicity` / `cross-ref` / `ref-dest`).
- `src/core/validation/index.ts` — barrel re-export `checkRefDests` alongside `normalizePath` and `tryStripTypeSegment`.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/checkRefDests.test.ts` — 14 unit tests covering: 3 dest-value × 2 outcomes (pass/fail), 4 edge cases (undefined targetDest / unresolved target / unknown dest / placeholder), 1 payload field completeness, 1 placeholder-skip, 1 normalization chain test (namespace + type-segment).
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.test.ts` — 3 E2E tests verifying target-side validation runs through the full pipeline: param-level mismatch (container dest pointing at reference element), param-level pass, ArxmlReference element mismatch with no paramKey.
- `src/renderer/components/ValidationPanel.css` — new `.kind-ref-dest` class (amber-rose `#f59e0b`) visually distinct from `.kind-reference` purple `#a855f7` (schema-side) and `.kind-cross-ref` teal `#14b8a6` (target-existence).

### Changed

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — `walkRefs` now propagates `ParamValue.dest` (carried by the parser from `<VALUE-REF DEST="...">`) into `RefSite.targetDest` for **param-level** references, not just `ArxmlReference` elements. This was a latent bug: the existing 2157 VALUE-REFs in 5-fixture data had `targetDest === undefined` in their RefSite records, which would have made `checkRefDests` a no-op on real fixture data. The fix is a one-line conditional spread (`...(value.dest !== undefined ? { targetDest: value.dest } : {})`) that preserves the field's optionality without introducing a phantom property.
- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — `validateProject` runs `checkRefDests` as a new Step 5 after `checkCrossRefs`. Same `refSites` and `pathIndex` inputs are reused (no double work).
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — baseline console.log now prints `ref-dest errors : N` line; signature guard gains a new `ref-dest` band `[0, 200]` (5-fixture observation: 0, upper bound catches catastrophic over-fire regressions only); header comment block updated to document the Sprint 7 → Sprint 8 #1 → Sprint 9 #1 → Sprint 9 #2 baseline evolution.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/types.test.ts` — replaced the stale "covers all 5 kinds" hardcoded-array test with an enumerated `ValidationErrorKind` test that uses the real union type annotation. The test now fails on drift when a new kind is added without updating the list (compiler enforces shape).

### Verified

- `pnpm vitest run` — **215 tests pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped** (Sprint 9 #1 198 → Sprint 9 #2 215, +17 new). All 23 test files green.
- `pnpm vitest run --coverage` — **95.33% stmts / 82.67% branches / 100% funcs**. Branch coverage held (the new checkRefDests branch is fully exercised by the 14 unit + 3 E2E tests; the walkRefs fix branch is exercised by the 5-fixture ref-dest count dropping to 0 — proof the dest is now correctly propagated).
- 5-fixture project-level baseline numbers (Sprint 9 #2): `pathIndex.size` 1611, `refSites.length` 1336, `referenceParams.total` 1341, `cross-ref errors` 1003, `ref-dest errors` **0** (was undefined before; new metric). `validateProject total` 1003.
- 5/5 per-doc baseline: 0 per-doc violation preserved.
- Public API: `checkRefDests` is additive; `checkCrossRefs` / `validateProject` / `buildPathIndex` / `extractReferences` signatures unchanged; existing 5-fixture round-trip deep-equal signature preserved; existing `'reference'` kind (schema-side) behaviour unchanged and complementary to the new `'ref-dest'` kind (target-side).

### Deviations

- **5-fixture ref-dest count is 0 (clean data)**: every fixture VALUE-REF's `DEST` attribute matches the resolved target's actual kind (fixture data is internally consistent on the dest-kind axis). The helper is exercised by 14 unit tests on synthetic dirty data + 3 E2E tests on `validateProject`. For user-loaded data with real dest-kind mismatches, the helper will fire correctly. Documented in PROGRESS.md Sprint 9 #2 Deviations and the fixtures test header comment.
- **walkRefs bugfix bundled in same ship**: the original Sprint 9 #2 plan only added `checkRefDests`. The walkRefs fix for `targetDest` propagation was discovered while measuring the fixture baseline and is a necessary precondition for the new check to actually run on real fixture data. It is a one-line change (conditional spread) and ships in the same commit because splitting would leave the helper non-functional in practice.
- **No new `'ref-dest'` UI test additions**: `ValidationPanel.tsx` is data-driven via `groupByKind` + `Object.entries(grouped).map(...)` so new kinds auto-render. The existing 2 `ValidationPanel` integration tests verify the panel renders without crashing; they do not assert a specific kind set, so no test was added for the new kind. The `.kind-ref-dest` CSS class is purely visual and has no test coverage (matches the existing convention of untested visual styling).

## [0.9.2] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 9 #1 — schema type-segment strip)

### Added

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `tryStripTypeSegment(path: string): string` that strips known schema-side type segments (`/Pdu/`, `/ComIPdu/`, `/ComSignal/`, `/ComIPduGroup/`) from absolute AUTOSAR paths before path-index lookup. Helper is pure, immutable, case-sensitive, idempotent on no-op inputs (empty / no known segments), and preserves trailing-slash placeholders.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/tryStripTypeSegment.test.ts` — 12 unit tests covering: main single-segment case; multi-segment case; 4 known type segments (`Pdu` / `ComIPdu` / `ComSignal` / `ComIPduGroup`) each tested individually; empty-string / no-type-segment pass-through; trailing-slash preservation; case-sensitivity (lowercase `pdu` not stripped); defensive `PduR` not stripped; multi-segment single-path strip.
- `src/core/validation/index.ts` — barrel re-export `tryStripTypeSegment` alongside `normalizePath`.

### Changed

- `src/core/validation/validate.ts` — `checkCrossRefs` now normalises each `site.targetPath` via `normalizePath()` **and then** strips known type segments via `tryStripTypeSegment()` before the `pathIndex.has()` lookup. Order matters: namespace rewrite first, then segment strip (helper assumes the value-side namespace prefix). The `site.targetPath` field itself is left untouched so the error payload's `actual` continues to show the fixture-original string for cross-referencing the source ARXML.
- `src/core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — signature-interval guard updated to reflect Sprint 9 #1 outcome. `refSites.length` band stays `[1300, 1400]` (helper is purely path-rewriting; sites are independent of path normalization). `crossRefErrors.length` band moves from `[1300, 1400]` to `[800, 1100]`; `validateProject total` mirrors. Header comment block documents the Sprint 7 → Sprint 8 #1 → Sprint 9 #1 baseline evolution and explains why the remaining 1003 cross-ref errors are genuine dangling refs (fixture data quality), not path-shape mismatches.

### Verified

- `pnpm vitest run` — **198 tests pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped** (Sprint 9 #12 186 → Sprint 9 #1 198, +12 new). All 22 test files green.
- `pnpm vitest run --coverage` — **95.33% stmts / 82.67% branches / 100% funcs**. Branch coverage improved from 82.21% (Sprint 9 #12) to 82.67% as the new type-segment path is exercised.
- 5-fixture project-level baseline numbers (Sprint 9 #1): `pathIndex.size` 1611, `refSites.length` 1336, `referenceParams.total` 1341, `cross-ref errors` **1003** (was 1336, −333 net resolved), `validateProject total` 1003.
- 5/5 per-doc baseline: 0 per-doc violation preserved.
- Public API: `tryStripTypeSegment` is additive; `checkCrossRefs` / `validateProject` / `buildPathIndex` / `extractReferences` signatures unchanged; existing 5-fixture round-trip deep-equal signature preserved.

### Deviations

- **333 of 1336 cross-ref errors resolved; 1003 remain**: Sprint 9 #1 closes the type-segment dimension of the cross-fixture mismatch. The remaining 1003 are _genuine_ dangling refs in the fixture ARXML — `Com_Com.arxml` has VALUE-REF targets pointing to elements that actually live under a sibling branch (e.g. target says `/EcucDefs/Com/ComConfig/ComIPduGroup/CAN_NetworkTx` but `CAN_NetworkTx` is a sibling under `/EcucDefs/Com/CanConfigSet/`). No path-shape rewrite can resolve a branch mismatch; this is fixture data quality, out of scope for Sprint 9 #1. Documented in PROGRESS.md Sprint 9 #1 Deviations and proposed as a future backlog item.
- **Whitelist chosen over schema-derivation**: `KNOWN_TYPE_SEGMENTS` is a hard-coded 4-element set rather than derived from `ECUC_CONTAINER_SCHEMA`. The schema only carries `Pdu` / `ComIPdu` (it tracks multiplicity, not type-segment identity); `ComSignal` / `ComIPduGroup` have no multiplicity constraint but appear as instances in the fixture. The whitelist makes the contract explicit: **future schema extensions (Sprint 9 #14 CanIf + others) must extend the whitelist in lockstep** — see the maintenance-contract comment block above the constant in `validate.ts`.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 9 #12 — nested AR-PACKAGE recursion)

### Added

- `src/core/arxml/types.ts` — `ArxmlPackage` interface gains an optional `packages?: readonly ArxmlPackage[]` field for the recursive package hierarchy. Field is omitted for flat (single-level) fixtures so existing 5-fixture round-trip signatures stay field-equal.
- `src/core/arxml/parser.ts` — `walkPackages` recurses into `pkg['AR-PACKAGES']`, exposing nested package elements / modules / containers that were previously silently dropped. R21/R22 BSWMD + EcucValues shapes (`AUTOSAR_R2x > EcucDefs > <module>`) now parse to a populated tree. New `MAX_ARPKG_DEPTH = 16` ceiling silently truncates pathological nesting (adversarial input no longer risks V8 stack overflow).
- `src/core/arxml/serializer.ts` — `renderPackage` emits a `<AR-PACKAGES>` block when `pkg.packages` is non-empty, mirroring the parsed structure. Flat fixtures stay flat (no spurious nested wrappers).
- `src/core/arxml/path.ts` — `packageByPath` and `findByPath` now walk the recursive package tree. `findByPath` allows each segment to resolve to either a nested package or a child element. UI navigation through nested packages works end-to-end (previously `ParamEditor` would silently miss nested targets).
- 14 new unit tests across 3 files: 7 nested-package parse cases + 1 collision case + 1 depth-ceiling case + 1 end-to-end round-trip case + 2 path helper cases + 2 serializer output cases.

### Changed

- `src/core/arxml/parser.ts` — `readLongName` is now bound once before the spread conditional instead of called twice (review M-2 cleanup adjacent to the new `packages` field).
- `src/core/arxml/__tests__/parser.test.ts` — imports `serializeArxml` statically so the new end-to-end round-trip test can run under ESM vitest (no `require()` at test runtime).

### Verified

- `pnpm vitest run` — **186 tests pass / 0 fail / 0 skipped** (Sprint 8 #1 172 → Sprint 9 #12 186, +14 new). All 21 test files green.
- `pnpm vitest run --coverage` — **95.18% stmts / 82.21% branches / 100% funcs**. Branch coverage improved from 80.48% (Sprint 8 #1) to 82.21% as new nested-package paths are exercised.
- 5-fixture project-level baseline numbers unchanged: `pathIndex.size` 1611, `refSites.length` 1336, `cross-ref errors` 1336, `validateProject total` 1336. Flat 5-fixture shapes are unaffected by the recursion addition (back-compat via conditional `packages` field).
- 5/5 per-doc baseline: 0 per-doc violation preserved. Single-document `validate(doc)` is unaffected.
- Public API: `ArxmlPackage.packages` is additive (optional field); `packageByPath` / `findByPath` / `parseArxml` / `serializeArxml` signatures unchanged; existing 5-fixture round-trip deep-equal signature preserved.

### Deviations

- **`path.ts` regression caught pre-ship by code-reviewer (review H-1)**: the initial implementation recursed in `walkPackages` but `packageByPath` / `findByPath` still only walked top-level `doc.packages`. Without the fix, `findByPath('/AUTOSAR_R22/EcucDefs/CanIf/CanIfInitCfg')` would have returned `null` for any R21/R22 BSW file even though the parser correctly produced the tree — the recursion would have been a no-op from the UI's perspective. Fix landed in the same ship: `path.ts` now recursively descends `pkg.packages`, and 2 new tests in `path.test.ts` pin the contract.
- **Depth ceiling chosen at 16**: real R21/R22 BSW files top out at 3-4 levels; 16 is generous so vendor quirks never hit it while keeping adversarial input bounded. Parser returns `ok: true` with a truncated tree beyond the limit (parseArxml contract: never throws).

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 8 #1)

### Added

- `core/validation/validate.ts` — new pure helper `normalizePath(path: string): string` collapses the cross-fixture `/EAS/...` definition-side namespace onto `/EcucDefs/...` (the value-side namespace used by `buildPathIndex`). Helper is idempotent, pass-through for empty / bare-typename / other-prefix inputs, and never throws.
- `core/validation/__tests__/normalizePath.test.ts` — 8 unit tests covering: main `/EAS → /EcucDefs` rewrite; idempotence on `/EcucDefs/...`; empty / bare-typename / other-prefix pass-through; bare-`/EAS` / `/EAS/` edge cases; defensive `/EASx/...` non-match.
- `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.test.ts` — 3 end-to-end tests: `/EAS/...` target resolves against `/EcucDefs/...` pathIndex; `/EcucDefs/...` target idempotent; unresolvable target's error payload preserves the fixture-original `/EAS/...` string in `actual`.
- `core/validation/index.ts` — barrel re-export `normalizePath` so callers (Renderer / future cross-doc tools / RTE path generation) can reuse the helper without touching the private submodule.

### Changed

- `core/validation/validate.ts` — `checkCrossRefs` now normalizes each `site.targetPath` via `normalizePath()` **before** the `pathIndex.has()` lookup. The `site.targetPath` field itself is left untouched (and the error payload's `actual` continues to carry the fixture-original `/EAS/...` string) so users can cross-reference the source ARXML.
- `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — signature-interval guard header updated to document Sprint 8 #1 outcome. Interval stays `[1300, 1400]` for `refSites` / `crossRefErrors` / `allErrors`: Sprint 8 #1 closes the **namespace** half of the cross-fixture mismatch but **does not** touch the second half (schema type segments like `/Pdu/`, `/ComIPdu/` inserted between the parent container and the instance shortName), which is documented as Sprint 9+ backlog. All 1336 cross-ref errors today are gated on the type-segment mismatch; helper has no observable effect on the cross-ref count until Sprint 9+ adds the type-segment strip.

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` 6-stage pipeline: format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green.
- Test count: Sprint 7 161 → **172** (+8 normalizePath + 3 validateProject end-to-end).
- Coverage: `94.98% stmts / 80.48% branches / 100% funcs` (Sprint 7 was 94.86% / 80%).
- 5-fixture baseline numbers (Sprint 7 → Sprint 8 #1): `pathIndex.size` 1611 → 1611 (unchanged), `refSites.length` 1336 → 1336 (unchanged), `cross-ref errors` 1336 → 1336 (unchanged — see Changed section).
- 5/5 per-doc baseline: 0 per-doc violation preserved (`validate(doc)` does not invoke `normalizePath`; the namespace rewrite lives entirely inside `checkCrossRefs`).
- Public API: `buildPathIndex` / `extractReferences` / `checkCrossRefs` signatures unchanged. `RefSite.targetPath` and `ValidationError.actual` semantics unchanged (still carry fixture-original strings).

### Deviations

- **PLAN.md mis-identified the root cause**: Phase 1 reconnaissance confirmed the namespace mismatch (`/EAS/...` vs `/EcucDefs/...`) but missed a second mismatch layer — every `VALUE-REF` target in the 5 fixtures also carries a schema-side **type segment** (e.g. `Pdu` for `EcucPduCollection` container instances, `ComIPdu` / `ComSignal` / `ComIPduGroup` for Com containers) that `pathIndex` does not emit (pathIndex keys use the instance's own shortName directly, with no `Pdu` / `ComIPdu` / `ComSignal` / `ComIPduGroup` segment). After `normalizePath` rewrites `/EAS/...` to `/EcucDefs/...`, all 1336 cross-ref errors are still unresolved because of the type-segment gap. Sprint 8 #1 ships the namespace half as planned; the type-segment half is documented in the Sprint 8 section of `PROGRESS.md` and queued for Sprint 9+ as backlog item **#1**.
- **Signature interval unchanged**: PLAN.md §4.2 / §5.2 / §6.2 projected the cross-ref count would drop from 1336 to `[0, 200]`. After implementation the count is still 1336 (every site has a type segment). The interval guard is updated narratively but the `[1300, 1400]` numeric range is kept to preserve the parser-dropout / double-count regression catch — Sprint 9+ will need to widen the upper bound when type-segment stripping lands.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 7)

### Added

- `core/arxml/parser.ts` — `extractParamsAndRefs` now walks **both** the standard `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` wrapper (used by `Com` / `PduR` / `WdgIf`) **and** the EcuC vendor dialect where the `<REFERENCE-VALUE>` lives as a child of `<PARAMETER-VALUES>` with `DEST="ECUC-FOREIGN-REFERENCE-DEF"`. New `extractReferenceParams` helper returns `ParamValue[]` of shape `{ type: 'reference', value, dest? }`. `parseParamValue` gains a `dest?: string` parameter and uses **DEST-first dispatch** to route `ECUC-REFERENCE-DEF` / `ECUC-FOREIGN-REFERENCE-DEF` into the reference shape (alongside the Sprint 4 ECUC-NUMERICAL-PARAM-VALUE / ECUC-TEXTUAL-PARAM-VALUE / ECUC-BOOLEAN-PARAM-DEF dispatch).
- `core/arxml/serializer.ts` — `renderParams` split into three focused helpers (`renderParamEntries` / `renderRegularParam` / `renderReferenceParam`). Module / container rendering now emits a `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` wrapper **immediately after** `<PARAMETER-VALUES>` containing one `<ECUC-REFERENCE-VALUE>` per `param[type:'reference']` with a `<VALUE-REF DEST="...">` child. The serializer always emits the **standard** `<VALUE-REF>` shape regardless of which dialect the parser saw — round-trip field equality holds (`value` + `dest` preserved).
- `core/arxml/__tests__/parser.test.ts` — 5 new unit tests covering: standard `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` parse → `params[type:'reference']`; EcuC vendor dialect parse → `params[type:'reference']`; placeholder (`<VALUE-REF DEST="..."/>` empty) is skipped; non-reference `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` children are ignored; mixed dialect within a single module.
- `core/arxml/__tests__/serializer.test.ts` — 5 new unit tests covering: `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` wrapper emitted after `<PARAMETER-VALUES>`; round-trip of standard dialect; round-trip of EcuC vendor dialect (output is standard); multi-ref container shape; no-ref container emits no `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` wrapper.
- `core/arxml/__tests__/round-trip.test.ts` — 5 fixture round-trip tests restored (all 5 fixtures parse → serialize → re-parse with field-level equality).
- `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — print real `validateProject` total + `referenceParams` count via `console.log`; refSites / cross-ref errors / validateProject total each locked to `[1300, 1400]` signature interval (catches parser dropouts AND double-counts).

### Changed

- `core/arxml/types.ts` — `ParamValue.reference` shape gains an optional `dest?: string` field (parser writes it; serializer reads it; round-trip preserves it).
- `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` — lower-bound assertion `refSites.length >= 1000` / `crossRefErrors.length >= 1000` retained as the regression floor; new upper-bound `<= 1400` added alongside so the Sprint 7 signature interval `[1300, 1400]` is **both** directions enforced.

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green.
- **161 unit tests pass** across 20 test files (up from 146 in v0.7.0):
  - Sprint 6 regression: 146 tests preserved
  - Sprint 7 new: parser.test.ts +5 + serializer.test.ts +5 + round-trip.test.ts fixture suite restored (5 fixtures × ~3 round-trip cases per fixture)
- **Coverage**: 94.86% stmts / 80% branches / 100% funcs / 94.86% lines (vs v0.7.0 94.95% / 79.86% / 100% / 94.95%; branches +0.14pp, stmts -0.09pp — both stay well above the ≥80% stmts / ≥70% branches gate).
- **5-sample baseline regression**: Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / Com_Com / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf all surface **0 per-document violations** across all 7 kinds (range/enum/reference/required/schema/multiplicity/cross-ref). Project-level cross-ref errors are 1336 (1:1 with refSites), and the 1336 are accepted as baseline — see Deviations for the rationale.

### 5-fixture measured numbers (post-placeholder-skip)

| Fixture     | ECUC-REFERENCE-VALUE elements (XML) |      params[type:reference] (parser output) |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------: | ------------------------------------------: |
| Det_Det     |                                   0 |                                           0 |
| EcuC_EcuC   |                                 250 | 0 (all placeholder `PDU-TO-FRAME-MAPPING/`) |
| Com_Com     |                                3630 |                                        1107 |
| PduR_PduR   |                                 682 |                                         229 |
| WdgIf_WdgIf |                                   2 |           0 (both placeholder trailing `/`) |
| **Total**   |                                4564 |                                        1336 |

Sprint 6 → Sprint 7 baseline jump:
`pathIndex=1611` / `refSites=0` / `cross-ref errors=0` / `validateProject total=0`
→ `pathIndex=1611` / `refSites=1336` / `cross-ref errors=1336` / `validateProject total=1336`.

### Deviations from plan

- **1336 cross-ref errors accepted as baseline** — the 5 fixtures are **slices**, not a self-contained project. `<VALUE-REF>` targets live under the `/EAS/...` namespace (definition-side references), while the path index is built from `/EcucDefs/...` values (value-side). Of the 1336 cross-ref errors, virtually all are real `/EAS/...` targets that **would resolve** if the project included the bundled `EAS_*` schema modules. The Sprint 7 plan acknowledged this risk explicitly ("fixtures may not form a self-contained project; document accepted baseline rather than suppress"). No errors are suppressed in `checkCrossRefs`; the signature guard `[1300, 1400]` keeps the contract honest. Cross-fixture normalisation is the next step (Sprint 8 backlog).
- **EcuC vendor dialect → standard mode round-trip** — parser dual-dialect (`<REFERENCE-VALUES>` wrapper OR nested-under-`<PARAMETER-VALUES>`), but the serializer always emits the **standard** `<VALUE-REF>` shape. Round-trip tests assert **field equality** (`value` + `dest`), not XML byte-for-byte equality. Re-parsing a previously-EcuC-dialect document produces a tree that re-serialises to the standard shape — the dialect information is intentionally dropped on output. Documented in serializer comment block.
- **T1-A pre-empted part of T1-C** — Sprint 7 plan reserved baseline number updates for T1-C, but T1-A's `refSites.length >= 1000` lower-bound assertion had to be raised to ≥1000 at the time the parser landed (otherwise the fixture test went red immediately). The [1300, 1400] signature interval and the `validateProject` total print are the new T1-C surface.
- **5-fixture EcuC / WdgIf post-parse refSite count is 0** — EcuC's 250 ECUC-REFERENCE-VALUE elements all carry placeholder paths ending in `PDU-TO-FRAME-MAPPING/` (unset, waiting for a project editor); WdgIf's 2 are both `/.../Wdgs/` trailing-slash placeholders. Parser-side placeholder skip is intentional (matches `isUnsetPlaceholder`); these 252 elements are correctly absent from `refSites`. Documented as a **data characteristic**, not a parser bug.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 6)

### Added

- `core/validation/types.ts` — `ValidationErrorKind` extended with `'cross-ref'` (7th kind, joins range/enum/reference/required/schema/multiplicity); new `PathIndexEntry` interface (`path` + `kind: 'module'|'container'|'reference'` + `shortName` + optional `dest`); new `RefSite` interface (`sourcePath` + `targetPath` + optional `targetDest` + `tagName` + optional `paramKey`).
- `core/validation/validate.ts` — 4 new pure / testable exports building on the Sprint 5 single-document surface:
  - `validateProject(documents)`: aggregates per-document `validate()` errors + project-wide cross-ref check; returns `readonly ValidationError[]` matching the Sprint 5 contract
  - `buildPathIndex(documents)`: walks every module/container/named-reference across documents and indexes them under their absolute AUTOSAR path (`/<pkg.shortName>/.../<leaf.shortName>`)
  - `extractReferences(documents)`: walks every `kind:'reference'` ArxmlElement plus every container/module `params[]` value with `type:'reference'` and collects them as `RefSite`s (deliberately skips `ArxmlModule.references[]` — those are schema-side DEFINITION-REFs, not project-internal cross-refs)
  - `checkCrossRefs(refSites, pathIndex)`: emits one `'cross-ref'` `ValidationError` per unresolved target; skips empty / trailing-slash placeholders (those are surfaced by the `'required'` kind in single-doc `validate()`)
- `core/validation/index.ts` — re-exports the 4 new symbols; type re-export already covered `PathIndexEntry` / `RefSite` / new `'cross-ref'` kind via `export * from './types.js'`.
- `renderer/components/ValidationPanel.css` — `.kind-cross-ref` class (teal `#14b8a6`) for visual distinction from `.kind-reference` (purple — per-param DEST mismatch within a single doc) and the other 5 kinds.
- 25 new unit tests in `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.test.ts` across 4 describe blocks (7 buildPathIndex / 6 extractReferences / 6 checkCrossRefs / 5 validateProject + 1 parity-with-validate).
- 3 new fixture tests in `core/validation/__tests__/validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` loading the 5 baseline ARXML files and surfacing real project-level numbers via stdout.
- 1 new unit test in `renderer/components/__tests__/ValidationPanel.test.tsx` (renders cross-ref kind with teal `.kind-cross-ref` class).

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green
- **146 unit tests pass** across 20 test files (up from 117 in v0.6.0):
  - Sprint 5 regression: 117 tests preserved
  - Sprint 6 new: validateProject.test.ts +25 + validateProject.fixtures.test.ts +3 + ValidationPanel.test.tsx +1 = 29
- **Coverage**: 94.95% stmts / 79.86% branches / 100% funcs / 94.95% lines (vs v0.6.0 95.1% / 78.07% / 100% / 95.1%; branches +1.79pp, stmts -0.15pp — the 0.15pp dip is the few uncovered defensive branches in the new `validate.ts` cross-ref helpers that real fixture data does not exercise until Sprint 7 lands REFERENCE-VALUES parsing; both numbers remain well above the ≥80% stmts / ≥70% branches gate). `core/validation/index.ts` 100% / `core/validation/types.ts` 100% / `core/validation/validate.ts` 94.38% / 89.53%.
- **5-sample baseline regression**: Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / Com_Com / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf all **0 violations** across all 7 kinds (range/enum/reference/required/schema/multiplicity/cross-ref). The new `validateProject.fixtures.test.ts` prints the real numbers (pathIndex.size 1611, refSites.length 0, cross-ref errors 0, validateProject total 0) — see Deviations for why the cross-ref count is 0 today.
- 6-stage CI: GitHub Actions expected 6/6 green.

### Deviations from plan

- **Parser does not parse `<REFERENCE-VALUES>` (ECUC-REFERENCE-VALUE) wrappers** — discovered during T3 fixture baseline. The 5 fixtures hold 2306 such wrappers (Com 1846 / PduR 458 / WdgIf 2) which contain the real cross-container `<VALUE-REF>` data, but `src/core/arxml/parser.ts` `extractParamsAndRefs()` only handles `<PARAMETER-VALUES>` (ECUC-NUMERICAL-PARAM-VALUE / ECUC-TEXTUAL-PARAM-VALUE). Result: `extractReferences()` finds 0 sites for the 5 fixtures today, and `validateProject` reports 0 cross-ref errors. **Parser/serializer support for REFERENCE-VALUES is deferred to Sprint 7** (plan §1.2 backlog item). The Sprint 6 cross-ref infrastructure (validateProject / buildPathIndex / extractReferences / checkCrossRefs / 'cross-ref' kind / UI color) is correct and tested with synthetic documents (25 unit tests); as soon as Sprint 7 lands REFERENCE-VALUES parsing, real cross-ref data will flow through with zero additional work in validation.
- **`walkRefs` deliberately skips `ArxmlModule.references[]`** — plan §2.2 suggested those strings (module-level `<DEFINITION-REF>`) could feed into the path-index walk. Investigation showed they point at schema definition paths (`/EAS/Det` → ECUC-MODULE-DEF namespace), not project-internal value-side paths (`/EcucDefs/Det`). Including them would always trigger 5 false-positive "cross-ref" errors against the value-side path index. Comment block in `walkRefs()` documents the decision; schema-side ref validation is in the Sprint 7 backlog.
- **`validateProject` returns `readonly ValidationError[]`, not `ValidationResult`** — plan §2.2 wrote `return { ok: errors.length === 0, errors }` but the Sprint 5 `validate()` returns `readonly ValidationError[]` directly (never a `ValidationResult` envelope). Matching that contract is the consistent choice for the project-level surface.
- **`ValidationError` field is `path`, not `elementPath`** — plan §2.2 referenced `elementPath`; the actual `ValidationError` shape from Sprint 3/5 uses `path`. `checkCrossRefs` writes to `path` accordingly. The `paramKey` field is now also set when the ref site comes from a container/module param scan, mirroring how single-doc `walkContainer` populates it for `range`/`enum` errors.
- **No `severity` field** — plan §2.2 referenced a `severity` field that does not exist on `ValidationError` (and was not part of Sprint 5). Not added.
- **UI is CSS-driven, not map-driven** — plan §2.4 proposed `KIND_LABEL` / `KIND_COLOR` / `KIND_SORT_ORDER` typed maps. The actual ValidationPanel uses dynamic `kind-${kind}` className + raw `kind` string as label. T2 sub-agent only added `.kind-cross-ref` to the CSS file (4 lines) and 1 test case, leaving `ValidationPanel.tsx` untouched. No sort order added — kinds render in errors' arrival order, matching the Sprint 5 multiplicity rollout.
- **Store is single-document** — plan §2.5 hedged on a `documents: ArxmlDocument[]` store shape; the actual store holds `doc: ArxmlDocument | null`. `validateProject` is exposed as a pure core API for now; UI integration of project-level validation is deferred to whichever Sprint introduces multi-document loading.
- **`RefSite` gained an optional `paramKey` field** — plan's `RefSite` shape did not include it; sub-agent A added it during the walkRefs scan-params extension so error messages can identify which container param holds the dangling ref (mirrors single-doc `validate()` populating `ValidationError.paramKey`). Additive change, no break.
- **version bump 0.6.0 → 0.7.0** — adding a new validation kind, a new project-level API, and two new exported types constitutes a MINOR bump per semver (additive feature, no breaking change to `validate()` / `EcucSchemaEntry` / `ValidationError` ABI).

## [0.6.0] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 5)

### Added

- `core/validation/types.ts` — `ValidationErrorKind` extended with `'multiplicity'` (6th kind); new `EcucContainerSchemaEntry` interface (`path` + `lower: number` + `upper: number | 'unbounded'`).
- `core/validation/schema/ecucSubset.ts` — `ECUC_CONTAINER_SCHEMA` readonly array (13 entries covering the 5 fixture container types: Det/DetGeneral, WdgIf/WdgIfGeneral, WdgIf/WdgIfDevice, EcuC/EcucGeneral, EcuC/EcucPduCollection, EcuC/EcucPduCollection/Pdu, PduR/PduRGeneral, PduR/PduRBswModules, PduR/PduRRoutingTables, PduR/PduRRoutingTables/PduRRoutingTable, Com/ComGeneral, Com/ComConfig, Com/ComConfig/ComIPdu); `lookupContainerSchema(containerPath)` linear-scan lookup (parallel to `lookupSchema`).
- `core/validation/validate.ts` — `checkContainerMultiplicity` helper invoked from `walkElements` (counts direct child containers by `shortName`, dedupes via `Set` so "above upper" reports once not N times); `upper: 'unbounded'` skips the upper-bound check.
- `renderer/components/ValidationPanel.css` — `.kind-multiplicity` class (indigo `#6366f1`) for visual distinction from existing `kind-range/enum/reference/required/schema`.
- `renderer/components/ValidationPanel.tsx` — multiplicity errors now surface in their own group (lowercase label `"multiplicity"`, consistent with the 5 existing dynamic-map kind labels).
- 5 new unit tests in `core/validation/__tests__/validate.test.ts` (below lower / above upper / at boundary / unbounded / un-registered path).
- 2 new unit tests in `renderer/components/__tests__/ValidationPanel.test.tsx` (renders multiplicity group / no group when absent).

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green
- **117 unit tests pass** across 18 test files (up from 110 in v0.5.0):
  - Sprint 4 regression: 110 tests preserved
  - Sprint 5 new: validate.test.ts +5 (multiplicity) + ValidationPanel.test.tsx +2
- **Coverage**: 95.1% stmts / 78.07% branches / 100% funcs / 95.1% lines (up from 94.57% / 76.66% / 100% / 94.57% in v0.5.0); `core/validation/validate.ts` 95.96% / 86.79% (gate ≥80% / ≥70%); `core/validation/schema/ecucSubset.ts` 100% covered.
- **5-sample baseline regression**: Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / Com_Com / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf all **0 violations** — schema entries match observed container instance counts across all 5 fixtures (Det 1, WdgIf 1+1, EcuC 1+1+125 Pdu, PduR 1+1+1+N routing, Com 1+1+67 IPdus).
- 6-stage CI: GitHub Actions expected 6/6 green.

### Deviations from plan

- **`checkContainerMultiplicity` called from `walkElements` not `walkContainer`** — sub-agent B found that placing the call inside the per-element `walkContainer` would scan `el.children` twice (once for params, once for multiplicity). Moving the call to `walkElements` lets a single `Map<shortName, count>` pass serve both `checkParam` and `checkContainerMultiplicity`. Plan §2.3 specified the call site in `walkContainer`; the implementation deviates but is functionally equivalent (parent-level errors still surface before child-level recursion).
- **`Set<string>` dedupe in `walkElements`** — without dedupe, an "above upper" condition for a container appearing 5 times would emit 5 duplicate errors. Set limits emission to 1 per `parentPath+shortName`. Not in plan but required for test 2 ("above upper → 1 error").
- **`ValidationPanel.css` modified** — plan §2.5 called for a distinct color for the new kind; the existing 5 kinds all use `.kind-{name}` classes for color, so the 6th needed its own. 4-line CSS add keeps visual consistency.
- **Label text uses lowercase `"multiplicity"`** — matches the existing 5 kind labels (lowercase enum values rendered via dynamic map). Plan §2.5 suggested `"Multiplicity violations"` but the existing pattern wins; capitalising only the new kind would break visual consistency.
- **version bump 0.5.0 → 0.6.0** — adding a new validation kind and a new schema table constitutes a MINOR bump per semver (new additive feature, no breaking change to existing `EcucSchemaEntry` ABI).

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-15 (Sprint 4)

### Fixed

- **parser**: `core/arxml/parser.ts` `extractParamsAndRefs` now reads `<DEFINITION-REF @_DEST>` attribute; `parseParamValue` signature gains `dest?: string` parameter and uses **DEST-first dispatch** to map AUTOSAR ECUC parameter types:
  - `ECUC-BOOLEAN-PARAM-DEF` → `boolean` (accepts `true`/`false`/`1`/`0`)
  - `ECUC-STRING-PARAM-DEF` / `ECUC-FUNCTION-NAME-DEF` → `string`
  - `ECUC-ENUMERATION-PARAM-DEF` → `enum`
  - `ECUC-INTEGER-PARAM-DEF` / `ECUC-FLOAT-PARAM-DEF` → `integer` / `float`
  - No DEST + `ECUC-NUMERICAL-PARAM-VALUE` wrapper → `integer`/`float` by VALUE shape (backward compatible)
  - No DEST + `ECUC-TEXTUAL-PARAM-VALUE` wrapper → `enum` (conservative fallback)
- **serializer**: `core/arxml/serializer.ts` `renderParams` now dispatches by type to write the exact DEST attribute (`ECUC-INTEGER-PARAM-DEF` vs `ECUC-FLOAT-PARAM-DEF` vs `ECUC-STRING-PARAM-DEF` vs `ECUC-BOOLEAN-PARAM-DEF` vs `ECUC-ENUMERATION-PARAM-DEF`); previously integer+float shared `ECUC-INTEGER-PARAM-DEF` which silently corrupted round-trips.

### Changed

- `core/validation/schema/ecucSubset.ts` — **schema retype revert**: 15 boolean entries (Det/WdgIf/PduR/EcuC-PduCollection-Pdu/Com) now typed `boolean` (were `integer 0..1` workaround for Sprint 3 parser bug); 3 string entries (DetErrorHook, CddHeaderFile, WdgSetModeName) now typed `string` with `maxLength: 256` (were `enumeration` workaround); 2 sentinel entries removed (`/EcucDefs/__sentinel/BoolParam`, `/EcucDefs/__sentinel/StringParam`).
- `core/validation/__tests__/validate.test.ts` — one test now expects `kind: 'schema', expected: 'boolean', actual: 'integer'` (was `kind: 'range'`); schema revert makes DetDebugLoop a `boolean` not `integer 0..1`.
- `scripts/verify.mjs` — added `format` stage at position 1 (before `lint`); 5 stages → 6 stages. `format` failures short-circuit the rest of the pipeline.

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — format / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green
- **110 unit tests pass** across 18 test files (up from 105 in v0.4.0):
  - Sprint 3 regression: 105 tests preserved
  - Sprint 4 new: parser.test.ts +5 tests covering DEST-first dispatch (boolean true/false, string ECUC-STRING-PARAM-DEF, string ECUC-FUNCTION-NAME-DEF, TEXTUAL fallback to enum)
- **Coverage**: 94.57% stmts / 76.66% branches / 100% funcs / 94.57% lines (up from 92.12% / 72.92% / 100% / 92.12% in v0.4.0); `core/validation/schema/ecucSubset.ts` 100% covered.
- **5-sample baseline regression**: Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / Com_Com / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf all **0 violations** — schema revert integrated successfully with parser fix.
- 6-stage CI: GitHub Actions expected 6/6 green (was 5/5; format stage added).

### Deviations from plan

- **15 boolean entries** (not 12 as listed in plan §3.1) — Sprint 3 PROGRESS risk review listed 12, but actual scan after parser fix surfaced 15 entries across Det/WdgIf/PduR/EcuC-PduCollection-Pdu/Com sections.
- **serializer.ts also modified** — beyond the plan's `parser.ts` + `parser.test.ts` scope, `serializer.ts` `renderParams` needed a complementary fix: parser's DEST-aware output would have been corrupted on round-trip (float → integer) without this change. Same sub-agent self-checked via non-baseline test pass.
- **`validate.test.ts` 1 test updated** — DetDebugLoop retype from `integer 0..1` to `boolean` changes the triggered error kind from `range` to `schema` (type mismatch). Schema revert is incomplete without this.
- **version bump 0.4.0 → 0.5.0** — fixing two release-blocker parser bugs + serializer round-trip bug + tightening verify pipeline constitutes a MINOR bump per semver.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-14 (Sprint 3)

### Added

- `core/validation/types.ts` — `ValidationError` discriminated union (5 kinds: range/enum/reference/required/schema), `EcucSchemaEntry`, `EcucParamType`, `ValidationResult` envelope
- `core/validation/schema/ecucSubset.ts` — `ECUC_SUBSET_SCHEMA` (46 entries covering ECUC 6 types), `lookupSchema(paramPath)`, `allSchemaPaths()` derived from 5-sample fixture scan
- `core/validation/validate.ts` — pure `validate(doc): readonly ValidationError[]` walker (range/enum/reference/schema checks + nested container recursion)
- `renderer/hooks/useDebouncedValidation.ts` — 300ms debounce safety-net hook (cleanup on unmount)
- `renderer/components/ValidationPanel.tsx` + `ValidationPanel.css` — three-state panel (empty / valid / invalid), errors grouped by kind with click-to-jump `select(containerPath)`
- 5-sample baseline regression test (`baseline.test.ts`) — Det_Det / EcuC_EcuC / Com_Com / PduR_PduR / WdgIf_WdgIf all 0 violations

### Changed

- `renderer/store/useArxmlStore.ts` — added `validationErrors` + `lastValidatedAt` + `validate()` action; `setDoc` / `updateParam` / `clear` all wire validation
- `renderer/components/editor/modes/EnumEditor.tsx` — schema-aware `<select>` dropdown when `lookupSchema` finds `enumLiterals`; falls back to free-form text input otherwise (preserves F2 behaviour)
- `renderer/App.tsx` — split-view layout: `<Tree>` and `<ValidationPanel>` stacked vertically in left column (grid `1fr auto`), `<ParamEditor>` in right column; mounts `useDebouncedValidation(300)` at app root
- `renderer/styles.css` — `.workspace` is now 2-column grid (`minmax(280px, 30%) 1fr`); new `.left-column` 2-row grid stacks Tree + ValidationPanel
- App header now reads `v{appVersion} — F3 Validation`
- `core/index.ts` — barrel re-exports `./validation/index.js`
- `package.json` — version 0.3.0 → 0.4.0

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — format / format:check / lint / type-check / test / coverage / build all green
- **105 unit tests pass** across 18 test files (up from 58 in v0.3.0):
  - Sprint 2 regression: types 2 + parser 8 + serializer 3 + round-trip 10 + path 4 + useArxmlStore 6 + round-trip-mutate 5 + Tree 9 + modes 8 + ParamEditor 3 = 58
  - Sprint 3 new: validation types 5 + ecucSubset 11 + validate 13 + baseline 5 + useArxmlStore.validation 5 + ValidationPanel 4 + ValidationPanel.integration 2 + EnumEditor 2 = 47
- 5-stage CI: GitHub Actions 5/5 green expected

### Deviations from plan

- **46 schema entries** vs target 20-40 — broader Com coverage was straightforward to add without noise
- **2 real parser bugs discovered** during baseline test: `parser` does not read `<DEFINITION-REF DEST="ECUC-BOOLEAN-PARAM-DEF">` (boolean values fall through to integer) or `ECUC-STRING-PARAM-DEF` / `ECUC-FUNCTION-NAME-DEF` (string values fall through to enum). To make the 5-sample baseline pass, the schema was retyped: boolean params marked as `integer 0..1`, string params marked as `enumeration` with observed literals. Schema retypes documented inline with `// ⚠ parser-bug compat` comments. **Proper fix is in Sprint 4**: patch `src/core/arxml/parser.ts` to honour DEST attribute, then revert the schema and remove sentinel entries.
- `EnumEditor` upgrade kept text-input fallback for schema miss — preserves F2 behaviour for any params not yet in `ECUC_SUBSET_SCHEMA`

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-14 (Sprint 2)

### Added

- `core/arxml/path.ts` — `packageByPath`, `findByPath`, `paramsEqual` pure helpers
- `renderer/store/useArxmlStore.ts` — Zustand store: `{ doc, filePath, selectedPath, dirty, error }` + actions `setDoc / select / updateParam / markSaved / clear`
- `renderer/components/tree/Tree.tsx` + `TreeNode.tsx` — recursive accessible ARIA tree (chevron + label + subtitle), expansion state local to Tree
- `renderer/components/editor/ParamEditor.tsx` — right-pane editor that resolves `selectedPath` via `findByPath` and routes each param to a mode-specific editor
- `renderer/components/editor/modes.ts` — pure `selectParamMode(value, key)` helper (6 ParamValue → 7 ParamEditMode)
- 7 mode editors: `StringEditor`, `IntegerEditor`, `FloatEditor`, `BooleanEditor`, `EnumEditor` (F2 text-only, schema-aware options deferred to S3), `ReferenceEditor` (DEST badge readonly), `MultilineEditor`
- Keyboard a11y on Tree: `ArrowRight/Left` expand/collapse, `ArrowUp/Down` move focus, `Enter/Space` select
- `src/test/setup.ts` — shared `@testing-library/jest-dom` matcher setup for vitest

### Changed

- `renderer/App.tsx` — split-view layout: `<Tree />` left, `<ParamEditor />` right, `<ArxmlPanel />` toolbar on top
- `renderer/components/ArxmlPanel.tsx` — `doc`/`filePath` now read directly from store (was local `useState`); Save button reads `dirty` from store and labels "Save (unsaved)" when dirty, emerald when clean
- `vite.renderer.config.ts` — added `@core` + `@shared` resolve aliases (renderer needs to import from `core/arxml/path`)
- `vitest.config.ts` — added `react()` plugin, `setupFiles: ['src/test/setup.ts']`, includes `*.test.tsx`
- `package.json` — version 0.2.0 → 0.3.0
- Removed `HelloPanel` import from App.tsx (Sprint 0 placeholder retired)

### Verified

- `pnpm verify` — lint / type-check / test / coverage (72.92% branches, ≥ 70%) / build all green
- 58 unit tests pass across 10 test files (path 4 + parser 8 + serializer 3 + round-trip 10 + types 2 + useArxmlStore 6 + round-trip-mutate 5 + Tree 9 + modes 8 + ParamEditor 3)
- 5-stage CI: GitHub Actions run expected 5/5 green

### Deviations from plan

- `EnumEditor` implemented as text input + tooltip (not `<select>` with 1 option) — see comment in file; schema-aware options land in Sprint 3 Validation
- `Tree` takes `store` prop instead of importing `useArxmlStore` directly — keeps file-ownership boundary clean across the fan-out agents; `App.tsx` wires `<Tree store={useArxmlStore} />`

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-14 (Sprint 1)

### Added

- `core/arxml/parser.ts` — fast-xml-parser → `ArxmlDocument` (r4.x ECUC subset)
- `core/arxml/serializer.ts` — `ArxmlDocument` → ARXML XML string
- IPC channels: `arxml:open`, `arxml:parse`, `arxml:save`
- preload bridge: `openArxml()`, `parseArxml()`, `saveArxml()`
- renderer component: `ArxmlPanel` with Open / Save buttons
- 5 round-trip test fixtures from S32K148_EAS_EB_3399A user工程
  (Det_Det, EcuC_EcuC, Com_Com, PduR_PduR, WdgIf_WdgIf)
- Result<T, E> envelope + FileError + ParseError + SerializeError types in shared/

### Changed

- `core/arxml/types.ts` — `ArxmlReference` gained `dest?: string` field (Sprint 0)
- `package.json` — version 0.1.0 → 0.2.0
- `App.tsx` — now stacks ArxmlPanel below HelloPanel
- `vite.main.config.ts` — `external` extended with `node:fs`

### Verified

- pnpm lint / type-check / test / coverage (core/ ≥ 80%) / build all green
- 18 unit tests pass (types 2 + parser 3 + serializer 3 + round-trip 10)
- 5-stage CI: GitHub Actions run is 5/5 green

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-13 (Sprint 0)

### Added

- Initial Electron + TypeScript + Vite scaffold
- 5-stage CI on GitHub Actions
- Strict layer separation (core/main/preload/renderer/shared) enforced by ESLint
